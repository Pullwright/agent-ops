       agent-cycle.sh --status

Run one cycle of the autonomous agent pipeline, or manage the switch that
stops cycles from starting (shared with review-cycle.sh).

  --dry-run          Select an item and print the work order; implement nothing.
  --once             One verbose cycle in the foreground.
  --repo <slug>      Restrict selection to one configured repo (testing).
  --disable [reason] Stop future cycles starting outright — in-flight work
                     included. A reason is required — the next person to
                     wonder why nothing is happening is entitled to one.
                     Expires after `disable_default_ttl` unless --for or
                     --until says otherwise. Issued while a --drain is active,
                     this tightens it to a full stop immediately.
  --drain <reason>   Stop new work being picked up, but keep finishing
                     whatever is already in flight — an open changes-requested,
                     merge-conflict, dequeued, or abandoned-draft pull request
                     — until every repo has nothing left to finish, then rest
                     there rather than exiting. A reason is required, on the
                     same terms as --disable. Same --for/--until/--this-node
                     handling as --disable, including which of --enable or
                     --enable --this-node clears it. Issued while a --disable
                     is active, this is a usage error — it would loosen a
                     stricter stand-down, which only --enable may do; issued
                     while a --drain is already active, it extends it, same as
                     re-issuing --disable does.
  --for <duration>   How long --disable or --drain lasts: 90m, 4h, 2d, or
                     `forever`.
  --until <timestamp> When --disable or --drain lasts until: a GNU
                     `date`-compatible absolute timestamp (e.g. '2026-08-10
                     18:00', 'tomorrow 12:00'), an alternative to --for. With
                     both given, the later of the two deadlines wins and a
                     warning is issued.
  --enable           Clear the switch — whichever mode it is in — and let
                     cycles run (or resume picking up new work) again.
  --this-node        Modifies --disable, --drain or --enable to act on this
                     node alone, never on the fleet switch: writes only this
                     node's own record, and for --enable clears only that
                     record, leaving `fleet/disabled.json` untouched either
                     way. Stands this one node down without a container
                     recreate — the rest of the fleet keeps working.
                     Combining it with anything but --disable, --drain or
                     --enable is an error. An unmodified --disable or --drain
                     also writes a local record, but tags it `scope: "fleet"`
                     to mark it a mirror of the fleet switch rather than a
                     node-scoped stand-down; --enable --this-node refuses to
                     clear one of those, since plain --enable is what undoes a
                     fleet-wide disable.
  --clear-limit      Lift a usage-limit stand-down across the fleet (2.1). Use
                     it once the limit is actually gone — you raised the cap,
                     or the plan rolled over. Unlike --enable this touches no
                     switch: it clears fleet/limit.json and logs a
                     `limit-cleared` event that supersedes the cooldown.
  --kill-merge-autonomy [reason]
                     Force every repo's effective `merge_autonomy` to `human`
                     fleet-wide, immediately, regardless of config.json or any
                     per-repo override — the D18 kill switch (docs/reviews/
                     2026-08-14-autonomy-investigation.md §6). A reason is
                     required, on the same terms as --disable. Reuses the
                     fleet-flag mechanism --disable/--enable share
                     (fleet/merge-autonomy-kill.json) but stops nothing else:
                     cycles keep running normally, only approval and landing
                     are forced back to human.
  --restore-merge-autonomy
                     Clear the kill switch and let each repo's configured
                     `merge_autonomy` level — and any per-repo override —
                     govern again.
  --status           Report the switch — distinguishing a node-scoped disable,
                     a fleet disable, or both, whether it is a full stop or a
                     drain (and, while draining, how much finishing-source
                     work is left as of the last cycle to check) — any
                     usage-limit stand-down, the merge-autonomy kill switch,
                     and whether either pipeline is running.
  --help             Display this help and exit.

--dry-run and --once bypass the no-op short-circuit (requirement 3b): a human
asking for a cycle wants the Co-Ordinator's answer, not a cached verdict. They
do not bypass the switch — if you disabled the pipeline to edit these files,
running them by hand is the same hazard.

The Enabler (requirement 35) runs at the very end of a cycle, once the
workspace is gone: --dry-run never engages it (a cycle that promises to change
nothing must not claim an item or raise an issue), while --once does — a
supervised engagement is the only way to watch one happen.

Environment:
  AGENT_OPS_ROLE   `active` on the one node that runs unattended cycles;
                   anything else (including unset) makes this a standby, which
                   skips them. --dry-run and --once bypass it; the switch
                   commands work on any node.

# TD-PPagop-26081407: a guarded call site (`cmd 2>&1) || { guard_warn ...;
# var=fallback; }`) that falls back to a literal on failure without saying so
# is indistinguishable from a genuinely empty/zero answer downstream — the
# defect the union log's `guard-degraded` event exists to remove. Every
# converted site captures the failed command's own stdout+stderr (its `2>&1`
# replaces the old `2>/dev/null`) and passes it here as `detail`; the fallback
# itself is never touched, only reported. Kept to one line per call site on
# purpose — 67 near-identical `jq -nc '{...}'` wrappers would be their own
# noise.
#
# The report is bounded on both axes, because its destination is the
# fleet-replicated union log — the unbounded input requirements 4c and 4g
# exist because of. A guard that fails *persistently* (a `date` parse of a
# field that is simply always absent, a `gh` outage across the repo loop)
# would otherwise write one event per occurrence per cycle per node: the
# first GUARD_WARN_SITE_MAX occurrences of each site label are reported, the
# last of them marked `final` so a reader knows the site may have kept
# failing unreported, and `detail` — a failed command's own output, which for
# a `gh api` body has no bound at all — is capped to its leading 500 bytes,
# where the cause is. A site label carrying a loop variable
# (`claim-count:<slug>`) still reports per slug; the cap is on repeats of one
# label, not on distinct sites. The tally is a shell variable, so a guard
# raised inside a command substitution counts only within it — those sites
# report unbounded within one cycle as before, which is the conservative
# direction to fail in for a cap whose only job is to stop noise.
#
# On a management command the report goes to stderr instead. --status runs
# before the lock and deliberately creates no cycle directory (see the
# comment above `mkdir -p "$cycle_dir"`) so that a read-only query leaves
# nothing behind; its `cycle_id` names a cycle that never ran, and stamping
# the fleet's shared log with one would be a record of a failed read during
# somebody's query, not of pipeline state. --disable/--enable do write to the
# log from this path, but they record a state change a human asked for.

# Untrapped, any of them ends bash between one statement and the next: no

# stage's own process group, which `set -m` detached from ours precisely so a
# timeout could kill it whole, is beyond every one of those signals, so the
# model runs on for work whose cycle is already dead.
#
# The handler's order is its design. The stage is stopped first, with KILL
# rather than TERM: the signaller's patience is unknown and may be two
# seconds, and a stage whose cycle is dead has nothing left to negotiate.
# The event lands second — one local file append, the thing that must
# survive, and what makes the death visible to requirement 34's blocked
# extract instead of silent. The claim release runs last and time-bounded
# (see `claim_release_timeout`): releasing now beats waiting out the gc's
# `claim_ttl_hours`, but not at the price of the record. Exiting through
# `exit` hands 128+n to the EXIT trap, so `cycle-end` reports the truth and
# `maybe_run_enabler`'s cycle_rc guard skips the Enabler unasked.

# 2026-08-01 argv-cap outage: `coordinator exited 126`, every node, every
# hour, ~15 hours), the record and the reality diverge completely. So the one
# signal that class does leave — the same failure, verbatim, over and over
# with no success anywhere in the fleet — is read here, from the same union
# every other fleet-wide judgement uses, and escalated the same way the
# Enabler escalates: an issue at the human, deduplicated, assigned so the
# pipeline can never select its own SOS as work. Before the stand-down
# checks, so a fleet that is also standing down (a limit, the switch) still
# raises the alarm; after the union snapshot, because the loop is a property
# of the fleet's memory, not this node's. The cycle then proceeds normally —
# detection must never suppress the recovery attempt that might end the loop.
#
# Two classes share this block, through the one `crash_loop_escalate` path:
# a Co-Ordinator that runs and fails identically (`crash_loop_verdict`), and
# a cycle that dies before any stage — Co-Ordinator included — ever starts
# (`crash_loop_preselection_verdict`, TD-PPagop-26081302). The second exists
# because the first is blind to exactly the shape both real outages took:
# `execve` failing on an oversized argv kills the cycle before `stage-start`
# for any stage is ever logged, so no `attempt-failed` exists for
# `crash_loop_verdict` to count. Each class keys its own item ref, so either
# can escalate independently of the other.
#
# `crash_loop_verdict`'s own run can additionally be *transient* (issue
# #1073): every failure it counted was the API being unreachable — a 5xx, a
# dropped connection — not the API refusing a request it considered. On
# 2026-08-29/30 the Ockham host lost outbound network for four hours and this
# block escalated it as "almost certainly deterministic … no amount of
# retrying will clear it" (#1070), which was false on the escalation's own
# evidence and cleared itself the moment the network returned. `escalate`
# (set by `crash_loop_verdict` itself, from each failure's own
# `api_refusal_class`) is what tells the two apart here: `false` means every
# failure in the run was `transient`, so this is a node/fleet connectivity
# fact, not a deterministic fault, and it is logged for the dashboard's node
# card instead of raised as an issue asserting a cause it cannot support.
# `crash_loop_preselection_verdict` carries no such class — an `execve`
# failure is never a network refusal — so its run always escalates exactly as
# it always has.
#
# A verdict here is always computed from the union log as it stood before
# this cycle's own Co-Ordinator attempt (if any) — this point in the script
# runs first, deliberately (the alarm must fire even on a cycle that stands
# down before reaching the Co-Ordinator at all). That makes a *first* attempt
# at filing this exact run reliable — nothing has looked at it before — but
# not a *retried* one: `crash_loop_escalate_or_defer` (lib/enabler.sh) files
# a verdict never before attempted immediately, exactly as `crash_loop_
# escalate` always has, but queues a deferred retry — or a fresh attempt that
# itself failed to file — for `crash_loop_refile_pending` to re-verify from
# `cleanup()`, once this cycle's own Co-Ordinator has had its chance to prove
# the run over (agent-ops#1074). Filing every retry here regardless of
# staleness is exactly what turned the 2026-08-29/30 Ockham outage's last
# hour into a false alarm (#1070): the escalation and the Co-Ordinator
# success that refuted it landed in the same cycle, the escalation first only
# because this block runs before the Co-Ordinator does. `crash_loop_retire_
# resolved` closes the other side of the same gap: an already-open Co-
# Ordinator-class escalation whose run has broken since, on any later cycle's
# ordinary union snapshot — no same-cycle race to lose, so no need to wait
# for `cleanup()`.
#
# Retirement runs FIRST, before either `crash_loop_escalate_or_defer` call
# below (agent-ops#1134 review). `create_escalation_issue`'s own open-issue
# dedup is a live `gh issue list` query, not a read of this cycle's
# `$union_log` — so if a resolved run's issue is still open when a *new*,
# same-detail run re-crosses `crash_loop_after` later in this same block,
# `create_escalation_issue` finds that still-open issue and rebinds it to the
# new run instead of filing a fresh one, and this retirement step then closes
# it out from under that live run on the strength of a `$union_log` snapshot
# that predates the rebind. Running retirement first closes the resolved
# run's issue before the new run's own filing attempt can see it, so that
# attempt's `gh issue list` no longer finds anything to reuse and opens a
# fresh issue instead — the new run gets its own alarm rather than inheriting
# one already closed for the old.

#
# Free: reads this node's own `state_dir/.doctor-status.json` — the hourly
# `doctor.sh --unattended` pass's own artefact (requirement 2.6a) — rather

# `enabler_assignee` — never `escalation_autonomy` (D18, agent-ops#627):
# that ladder decides whether one specific escalation, an Enabler
# refinement-disagreement (requirement 36b), is adjudicated once before
# reaching a human, and there is no disagreement to adjudicate here, only a
# date comparison — the same reasoning 2.0b's own block gives for the
# identical choice.
#
# Deduplicated on the expiry timestamp itself (`token_expiry_escalated_for`,

# actually rotated, which is exactly when the expiry timestamp changes.

# Deferred from step 2.2 until the sources were gathered. Back-pressure's stated
# purpose is to throttle new work and stop the landing gate silting up — and the
# four *finishing* sources do neither: `review-feedback` answers a review the
# human has already written, `merge-conflicts` rebases a ready PR that is
# waiting to land, `dequeued` fixes the merge-group checks failure that got a
# ready PR of ours removed from the merge queue, and `abandoned-drafts`
# carries a stalled draft this system started to completion. All are the
# activity that *un*-silts the gate — indeed an abandoned draft is itself
# occupying one of the very back-pressure slots the cap is counting, and a
# conflicted or dequeued PR is one nothing can land to free a slot until it
# is fixed. So when back-pressure trips we do not stand down if
# any has work waiting; we restrict every repo's source list to those four.
#
# No new prompt machinery is needed for that, and deliberately so: the
# Co-Ordinator is already told the runtime input's `sources` are authoritative
# over its own table (requirement 15). Narrowing the list is therefore an
# instruction it already knows how to obey, and the restriction cannot be
# reasoned around — a source it cannot see is a source it cannot select.
# The system still cannot open a new PR while the gate is full; it can only
# finish what is already in it.
#
# "a conflicted or dequeued PR is one nothing can land to free a slot until
# it is fixed" above claims those two already hold a slot requirement
# 2.2's own count counts — but that count was taken before this cycle's
# merge-conflict and dequeued candidates were gathered (they arrive only
# once ordered_repos_json's sources are populated, in step 3), and neither
# gatherer's candidate rule reads `reviewDecision` at all
# (scripts/gather-merge-conflicts.sh, scripts/gather-dequeued.sh) — so a
# conflicted or dequeued PR that is not *also* `CHANGES_REQUESTED` passed
# through 2.2's count exactly like an ordinary human-queue PR. For `dequeued`
# it is not even a coincidence: a PR only reaches the merge queue after
# approval, so its `reviewDecision` is `APPROVED` by construction. Fold in,
# here, whatever `counted_prs_json` — 2.2's own record of which PRs its count
# held — does not already hold, so the trip decision made at this site
# actually reflects every slot that source occupies, not just the ones that
# happened to also be `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. `ordered_repos_json` already
# carries this cycle's `merge_conflicts`/`dequeued` candidates (gathered
# above, in step 3) whether or not back-pressure ends up tripped, so this
# runs unconditionally rather than only inside the `if` below.

# --- 3b. No-op short-circuit (requirement 3b) ---

# input to its verdict is byte-identical to the last time it declined, the
# verdict is already known and buying it again buys nothing.
#
# The fingerprint must cover *every* input — see lib/noop-skip.sh for the map
# of source to signal, and for why a gap here is a silent stall rather than a
# visible bug. Two of them are not repo state at all and are the easiest to
# leave out: the config that decides which repos and sources exist, and the
# prompt that holds the selection rules. Without them, editing coordinator.md
# — or a configured prompt_overrides.coordinator fragment (requirement
# 4a) — would do nothing until an unrelated commit happened to land somewhere.
#
# `repo_nice` belongs in this same object for the same reason, though what it
# guards against is the ordering feature (requirement 3, lib/repo-order.sh)
# rather than a source: repo *order* is deliberately normalised out of the
# fingerprint — `sort_by(.slug)` in lib/noop-skip.sh's canon, asserted by
# test/noop-skip.test.sh — because the walk order was never itself an input
# to what the Co-Ordinator may select, only to which candidate it reaches
# first. An edit to a repo's `nice` changes only that order, so without this
# key such an edit would move nothing: the exact silent-stall shape the rest
# of this block already describes, just reached from the ordering side
# instead of a missing source. Only non-zero entries are carried, and the key
# is omitted entirely when the map is empty — repo_nice_selection_config
# (lib/repo-order.sh) returns `{repo_nice: …}` or a bare `{}` accordingly —
# so a config with no `nice` set anywhere fingerprints byte-identical to how
