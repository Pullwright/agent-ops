# lib/rework.sh — the rework record (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md, D23 of
# docs/ROADMAP.md, issue #596).
#
# One shaping function, called from every detector site this repo already
# has — agent-cycle.sh's selection/handback/stage-end paths, lib/enabler.sh's
# crash-loop escalation, lib/refinement.sh's refiner verdict loop, and
# scripts/publish-revert-rate.sh's standalone mining pass. Every one of those
# already knows, from its own detector firing, which class this repetition
# is, what evidence it fired on and (sometimes) which stage it is attributed
# to; this function only shapes that into the one documented record shape.
# It never classifies, never reads a transcript, and never asks a model — the
# "account, not a guess" line docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md draws.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shell options are set here, matching every
# other lib/*.sh — the caller owns those.

# rework_fields CLASS DETECTOR EVIDENCE_JSON [ATTRIBUTED_STAGE [REPO [ITEM [PR_URL]]]]
# Print the `rework` event's own fields — everything docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md
# documents beyond the envelope a caller's own logger already adds
# (ts/cycle/node): `class`, `detector`, `evidence`, `attributed_stage`, and
# `repo`/`item`/`pr_url` where the caller has them ("where applicable" —
# several classes, crash-loop-escalated foremost, are fleet-wide rather than
# about one item).
#
# ATTRIBUTED_STAGE is the empty string, by default, meaning "not determined
# from the detector's own evidence" — recorded as a JSON `null`, never a
# guess (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md's attribution rule): a caller passes a stage
# name only when its own detector's evidence names one directly, never by
# arbitrating between plausible causes.
#
# EVIDENCE_JSON must already be a JSON value — the detector's own raw
# output (an event id, a check name, a comment id, a kill_reason, a claim
# cause), never a summary and never re-derived here. A caller that hands
# this something unparseable gets `evidence: null` rather than a failed
# call — the same degrade-not-fail contract lib/metering.sh's
# `metering_fields` keeps, because this is interpolated into the same
# `log_event` `--argjson` merge every other event field is (see
# lib/metering.sh's own header for what an unparseable argument there costs
# the whole event).

# for that reason and is the only one that calls `log_event` itself, since
# every one of its call sites wants exactly "log it if it fires" and nothing
