# lib/coordinator-input.sh — fit the Co-Ordinator's runtime input inside its
# model's context window (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md requirement 4i,
# agent-ops#641).
#
# Requirement 4g moved every fleet-state aggregate off argv because
# `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` had taken the fleet down; its own spec text records that
# doing so "raised the ceiling; it did not stop the set from still climbing
# toward whatever ceiling came next". This module is what happens when the
# next ceiling arrives. On 2026-08-21 the Co-Ordinator's assembled prompt
# reached ~226580 tokens against its model's 200000-token window and every
# node failed identically, four cycles running, `coordinator exited 1` with an
# empty `coordinator.out.stderr` — the API refusal is in `coordinator.out`,
# not on stderr, so the fleet's own escalation pointed at an empty file
# (agent-ops#641). Nothing had gone wrong: the input had simply grown, one
# issue comment at a time, from 212999 tokens to 226580 over four cycles, past
# a limit no code in this repository had ever measured itself against.
#
# ## What is bounded, and what is not
#
# The bound is on the *assembled prompt*, because that is the thing the window
# rejects — not on the runtime input alone. The base prompt is over 100 KB of
# its own and grows with every requirement written into it, so budgeting only
# the input would let prompt growth silently eat the input's headroom and
# arrive back here. `agent-cycle.sh` therefore measures the rendered base
# prompt, subtracts it (and the rest of the input document that is not
# sheddable), and hands what is left to this module as the allowance.
#
# What this module sheds is prose from the two bands that carry a whole
# document each — `issues` (an issue's entire thread) and `tech_debt` (an
# entire register file). That pairing is not new here: requirement 2.2a's
# back-pressure block already singles out exactly those two, for exactly the
# same reason, when it empties them on a restricted cycle. Every other band is
# left alone, and deliberately: `review-feedback`, `merge-conflicts`,
# `dequeued`, `landing-refusals`, `abandoned-drafts`, `register-hygiene` and
# `human-visibility` all
# carry bodies `prompts/coordinator.md` requires pasted *verbatim* into the
# work order, they are bounded by the number of open pull requests rather than
# by history, and together they were 34 KB of the 354 KB that overflowed.
#
# ## Prose is shed; candidacy is not
#
# Every rung below removes text and leaves the entry a candidate, with its
# `ref`, `number`, `url`, `title`, `priority`, `labels` and `updated_at`
# untouched — an item the Co-Ordinator can still see, still rank and still
# select. What it cannot do is paste an elided body verbatim into the work
# order, so every cut leaves a marker naming how many bytes went and where the
# whole of it lives, and `prompts/coordinator.md` obliges a live read of that
# URL before selecting a marked entry. The cost is therefore one fetch for the
# one item actually selected, not a thread's worth of tokens for every item
# considered.
#
# The last rung is the exception, and is last for that reason: with the
# tightest per-entry caps applied there is nothing left to shed but entries
# themselves, and an entry dropped here is one the Co-Ordinator never sees.
# Dropping is by a stated order (least important last-kept), the count is
# recorded on the repo entry the Co-Ordinator reads and in the union log, and
# `agent-cycle.sh` applies the whole fit *before* `coordinator_eligible_items`
# — so requirement 3x's corroboration measures the set actually offered and a
# dropped entry can never read as an unaccounted-for decline.
#
# ## Why a ladder rather than a computed cut
#
# A per-entry allowance divided out of the budget punishes small entries for
# their neighbours' size and needs a second pass to redistribute the slack. The
# ladder instead states six shapes of input, generous first, and walks only as
# far as the budget requires: an ordinary cycle stops at the first rung having
# trimmed nothing at all, and each rung a cycle does reach is a sentence a
# human can read off the log ("newest 3 comments, 1500 bytes each"). Every rung
# is re-measured against the real assembled document rather than predicted, so
# the ladder converges whatever the input's shape.
#
# ## Freshness is shed for the non-selected majority (requirement 48)
#
# Everything above assumes each repo entry's eight bands were read this
# cycle. Since agent-ops#1086 that is only guaranteed for one repo per cycle
# per node (lib/expensive-gather-cache.sh): every other configured repo's
# entry carries whatever this node's own cache last captured for it, which
# can be many cycles old. This module's own ladder does not care — it fits
# bytes, not freshness, and a cached entry's prose is exactly as eligible for
# trimming as a fresh one's — but a reader of the fitted array does care, so
# `lib/candidate-gather.sh` stamps every entry, cached or fresh, with
# `expensive_gather: {fresh: bool, gathered_at: <ISO-8601>|null}` before this
# module ever sees it. `fresh: true` names the one repo this cycle actually
# read; every other entry's `fresh: false` and `gathered_at` are what
# `prompts/coordinator.md` points to when it tells the Co-Ordinator a
# non-fresh entry needs a live re-check before selection, the same
# live-read-before-you-select obligation this module already places on a
# trimmed entry, extended to cover an entry that is stale rather than merely
# short. `gathered_at: null` names a repo this node has never yet read at
# all, which the `none-selected`/no-op paths must treat as "unsampled",
# never as "sampled and found nothing" — the same distinction
# `gather-source-state.sh`'s own `ok` flag draws for the signals it proxies.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh.

# The ladder: `comments_kept:comment_bytes:body_bytes`, generous first. The
# first rung trims only pathological outliers — a 20 KB body or a 12 KB
# comment is already past what any reader needs to rank an item — and the last
# leaves a title, the identity fields and an opening paragraph. The steps
# between are deliberately close together: a coarse ladder overshoots, and an
# input a few kilobytes over the allowance should lose a few kilobytes of
# prose, not half the thread it happened to sit above. Byte caps, not
# character caps, because bytes are what the window is spent in: JSON-escaped
# Markdown runs about 2.35 bytes per token, roughly half the ~4 of the prose it
# encodes, because every newline and quote in it becomes an escape.

# Decision (agent-ops#683): the bottom rung above stays a trim, not a drop.
# Reaching it used to mean every candidate's body was cut to a title-level
# fragment, comments emptied outright, and the Co-Ordinator — correctly
# following its own prompt's "if you cannot tell what done would mean, report
# needs_refinement" — dutifully reported exactly that for its whole visible
# backlog, which requirement 3x's completeness bar then compelled the Script
# to record as blocks (nine items in 68 seconds, 2026-08-21). That made
# "drop entries here instead of trimming them" a real candidate fix: an entry
# this small could not be judged either way, so keeping it costs a candidate
# slot for something the Co-Ordinator cannot use.
#
# `coordinator_fit_trim_refusal_reason` above removes that harm at its
# source: a trimmed entry can no longer force a block, so all a bottom-rung
# entry still buys the Co-Ordinator is its identity fields (`ref`, `title`,
# `priority`, `labels`, `updated_at`) — enough to rank it, and enough to
# select and live-read it should its title alone look worth the fetch.
# Dropping it instead would remove that option for no remaining harm left to
# trade it against, so the ladder is unchanged: eight rungs, generous first,
# `0:0:1000` last.

# shrink is not "trimmed" just because its neighbours were.
#
# This is the exemption set behind requirement 34e's fourth refusal and
# requirement 3x's matching completeness exception (agent-ops#683): on
# 2026-08-21 a context-tight cycle's fit reached its bottom rung, every
# candidate's body was cut to a title-level fragment, and the Co-Ordinator —
# correctly following "if you cannot tell what done would mean, report
# needs_refinement" — reported exactly that for its whole visible backlog,
# which requirement 3x's own completeness bar then obliged the Script to
# record as blocks. Neither rule was wrong; the fix is a Script-side refusal
# to write the block, and a matching carve-out so declining to write it does
# not itself read as an unaccounted verdict.
#
# Detected the same way a human reading the rendered prompt would: the
# elision marker `fit_entry`'s own `clip` leaves in a clipped body, the same
# marker in a clipped *comment* body, or the `comments_elided` key it adds
# when the comment list itself was cut. All three, because all three take
# text away from the same reader: an issue whose body is two lines and whose
# acceptance criteria live in a Refiner's comment — the ordinary shape in
# this repository — is trimmed past what "done" means by a middle rung that
# clips that one comment and touches nothing else. Never
# re-measured against the byte caps here — that arithmetic already ran once,
# inside the ladder, and re-deriving it from an entry's current byte length
# would drift the moment either side changed independently. The literal

# harm of the rare false refusal is far smaller than the harm of asking the
# question at all on a cycle whose whole backlog was trimmed this far.
