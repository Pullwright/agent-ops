# --- 2. Stand-down checks ---
# 2.0 GitHub API budget (requirement 2.0). First of the stand-down checks
# because it is the cheapest one: two points — one metered `GET /meta` for its
# `x-ratelimit-*` headers and one GraphQL `rateLimit` query — against the
# thousands every check below it can spend, the usage-limit probe most of all.
# Not the free `GET /rate_limit`: read cold, its body is an empty window, not
# a reading, and this gate answered `ok` from it through 95 refusals
# (agent-ops#1087; lib/github-limit.sh's header has the measurement).
#
# What this prevents is not the failed `gh` call. It is the cycle of
# 2026-08-12T20:52Z, which read a rate-limited GitHub as a quiet one: every
# gatherer degraded to `[]`, the Co-Ordinator engaged on that digest and chose
# an item, the claim was taken, and the cycle then died at the clone with
# `GraphQL: API rate limit already exceeded`. All of that is downstream of a
# question GitHub would have answered for free before the first token was
# spent.
#
# `unknown` — the meter itself unreadable — is deliberately not a stand-down.
# It is no evidence about the budget, and a node that cannot reach
# `/rate_limit` could not have run a cycle anyway; the failure it does have
# will be reported by whatever call meets it. Standing down here would invent
# a way for a network blip to look like an exhausted account.
# The reading is recorded first (requirement 2.0d) — whether or not a floor is
# set, since the record is what D25's "measured to bind" trigger reads — and
# the verdict judges that same reading rather than paying for a second one.

# 2.0b GitHub credential check (requirement 2.0b, agent-ops#691). The same
# free `/rate_limit` call classifies a 401, and a missing token, apart from
# every other failure: either GitHub read the request and rejected the
# credentials outright, or `gh` had no credentials to send in the first
# place — both permanent, unlike 2.0's `exhausted` or 2.1's cooldown below,
# since no wait and no retry clears an expired, revoked or absent token.
# Checked here, ahead of the Co-Ordinator (step 4), because that stage is
# what a dead token wastes: on 2026-08-22 a node whose fine-grained PAT had
# expired ran a full Co-Ordinator engagement every cycle for ~3 hours ($1.05
# across five cycles) before a human noticed, every claim failing with
# `cause: "unreachable"` and the cycle reporting "this is an outage, not
# contention" — the one classification that sends nobody looking at the
# token. TD-PPagop-26082306 is the same fault in a different shape: a token
# unset or dropped from the environment failed the probe's stderr match too,
# so it also read as `unreachable` rather than `unauthorized`.
#
# Deliberately unconditional, unlike 2.0: a dead token is worth catching
# even on a node that has turned `github_min_core_budget` /
# `github_min_graphql_budget` off, and the call costs nothing either way
# (same free `/rate_limit` endpoint).
#
# Not routed through `escalation_autonomy` (D18, agent-ops#627): that ladder
# decides whether one specific kind of escalation — an Enabler
# refinement-disagreement (requirement 36b) — is adjudicated once before
# reaching a human. Its `adjudicate-first` path is itself a model engagement
# against GitHub, which a dead token defeats exactly as it defeats the
# Co-Ordinator; routing through it here would reintroduce the spend this
# check exists to avoid. This follows 1c's and 2.7's own precedent instead —
# an operational fact about the node, not a per-item disagreement — and

# escapes.sh` is the independent, read-only audit, deliberately reimplementing
# `lib/landing.sh`'s protected-path list and never calling `landing_eligible`
# (its own header explains why), rather than being sourced or trusted the
# way `_landing_retry_sweep_repo` above reuses the real gates verbatim — an
# audit that shared the code it exists to check could not catch a bug in
# that shared code. Same sweep shape as `scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh`
# (above): stdout is one JSON object per newly-audited pull request, this
# loop is what actually appends anything to the log — a standalone script
# never may, per requirement 33's single-writer rule. Fleet-wide regardless
# of `--repo`, and safe on `--dry-run`: it never arms or lands anything,
# only reads GitHub's own merged-PR record and the fleet log. Run every
# cycle rather than gated on `merge_autonomy`: idempotent against its own
# prior findings (LOG_FILE) for any pull request this repository has already
# produced a `classifier-escape`/`landing-audit`/`landing-audit-skip` event
# for, regardless of who merged it — a repository sitting below
# `agent-merges-routine`, where a merge under the Approver identity is rare
# or never happens, still pays the one `repos/SLUG/pulls/N` read each such
# pull request needs to learn who merged it, but only once: that fact is
# recorded (as `outcome: "not-approver"`, logged below as
# `landing-audit-skip`) exactly like an audited landing is, so it is never
# paid again on a later cycle. `timeout 120` bounds what a single cycle
# spends on this either way, and while a repository with a large backlog of
# never-yet-recorded pull requests may need several cycles to work through
# it, each cycle's budget goes further than the last rather than being
# pinned at a permanent frontier — see the script's own "Idempotency"
# section for what oldest-first candidate order buys and for the size of
# that backlog on this repository as of 2026-08-22. The same

# 2.2 Back-pressure — across ALL configured repos, regardless of --repo.
#
# The stand-down is *deferred* rather than taken here (requirement 2.2a). Back-
# pressure throttles starting new work, and until the sources are gathered we do
# not know whether the only candidate is review-feedback — which finishes work
# already parked in whichever queue requirement 2.2's merge_autonomy-aware
# exclusion currently holds it in (a human's, below agent-merges-routine; see
# D18 WI-6 below) instead of adding to it. Standing down here would
# deadlock the pipeline exactly when it is most stuck: max_open_agent_prs PRs
# all waiting on the agent, and the one source that could clear them never
# reached. The cost of deferring is the handful of `gh` calls in step 3.
#
# A ready PR only counts toward the trip when the pipeline itself has a next
# action on it — `reviewDecision == CHANGES_REQUESTED`, the same "whose turn
# is it" rule requirement 3c's review-feedback candidate filter uses
# (scripts/gather-review-feedback.sh), so the two definitions cannot disagree.
# A ready PR that is approved, or awaiting a first or re-review with nothing
# currently `CHANGES_REQUESTED`-blocking it, is sitting in a human's queue only
# below agent-merges-routine (D18 WI-6, the level-aware loop below) — the
# pipeline cannot shrink that queue by declining to open new work, so counting
# it against the cap only back-pressures the fleet for a queue it has no lever
# to drain (agent-ops#246). At agent-merges-routine and above there is no such
# queue for it to sit in, and it counts like any other ready PR (see
# `backpressure_autonomous_rank` below).
#
# The count is taken in four parts — ready PRs awaiting a human (only below
# agent-merges-routine; see D18 WI-6 below), ready PRs awaiting the pipeline,
# draft PRs, live claims — because the trip decision needs only the
# human-queue-excluded sum, but the logged reason states the full split: a
# human-queue PR could fill the raw total without ever counting against the
# cap, at levels where such a queue exists; a pipeline-turn ready PR is that
# queue answered (or, at agent-merges-routine and above, simply the next
# ready PR) and now the agent's to act on; a draft is work in flight (the
# Implementer's own claim marker, requirement 23); an unraised claim is a
# registry entry whose PR does not yet exist. Which of them filled the gate
# is what a cap-tuning decision needs to know. Recording it here costs
# nothing; reconstructing it later means cycle-record archaeology.
#
# The listing's page size is stated (`GITHUB_PR_LIST_LIMIT`, lib/github-limit.sh)
# rather than left to `gh`'s undeclared default of 30, and a response that came
# back at it is treated as a trip. This is the one place in the pipeline where
# a truncated listing is actively dangerous: `gh` gives no signal that it
# capped, so the counts below would simply be low, and low counts open a gate
# whose whole purpose is to stay shut. Note that the raw listing is not bounded
# by `max_open_agent_prs` — a pull request sitting in whichever queue
# requirement 2.2's merge_autonomy-aware exclusion currently parks it in still
# carries `pr_label` and is deliberately excluded from the sum — so a repo can
# genuinely hold more open labelled PRs than the cap, and the cap is no
# guarantee the page was big enough.
#
# Live claims count toward the cap too: a claim is work in flight that has
# not yet surfaced as a PR, and N nodes counting only PRs would collectively
# overshoot by the work each other had claimed but not yet raised. Still
# approximate — two nodes can pass this check simultaneously — with a stated
# bound of max_open_agent_prs + (nodes - 1), transient.
#
# "Not yet surfaced as a PR" is the whole of it, and it is why each repo's
# claims are counted *here*, inside the same iteration as its own PR listing,
# rather than in a second loop of their own: `claim.sh count` is told which of
# this repo's pull requests the sum above already holds, and drops any claim
# that merely names one of them. Two claim shapes name a PR. The PR-keyed
# `pr-<n>` exclusion entry (issue #238) is held past its PR's own raising
# (issue #360) and `claim.sh` drops it unconditionally; the item claim beside
# it carries the `pr-<n>-<kind>-<scope>` ref the four finishing sources use,
# and until now it was counted — a claimed abandoned draft was its own draft
# PR *plus* its own claim, two against a cap it occupies once. Only the PRs
# actually inside the sum are passed, so a conflicted or dequeued PR that the
# rule above leaves out of the sum keeps counting through its claim, which is
# then the only record of it in flight.
