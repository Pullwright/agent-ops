# SC2016: the backticks in the truncation marker and in the jq programs below
# are literal Markdown code spans in the text this file renders, never shell
# expansions — the same blanket lib/pager.sh carries for the same reason.
#
# lib/monitor-digest.sh — what the Pipeline Monitor reads instead of the
# records themselves (issue #1284, docs/MONITOR-PIPELINE-SPEC.md M6/M7).
#
# The primary records this pipeline exists to reason over are not readable by
# a model: the fleet's union `log.jsonl` is measured in megabytes and the
# dashboard's `data.js` in the same order. Handing either to a stage would
# spend a context window on transport and still arrive truncated at an
# arbitrary place. So the Script reads them and the model reads this — one
# deterministic digest, assembled by jq from files that already exist, with
# every section's shape fixed here rather than left to whatever the stage
# happened to grep.
#
# Deterministic is the load-bearing word. Two runs over the same inputs must
# produce the same digest, because the Monitor's own dedup (M13) keys on
# findings a previous run stated, and a digest that reshuffled its samples
# would produce a different reading of the same day. Every function here is
# therefore a pure reader: it takes paths and JSON on argv, never reads
# `config.json`, never calls `gh`, and never writes anything. The one input
# that cannot be derived from a file — what the forge currently holds — is
# fetched by the caller and handed in as JSON, which is also what keeps this
# file testable against a fixture directory with no network at all.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shell options are set here, matching every
# other lib/*.sh — the caller owns those.
#
# Every reader below degrades to its empty shape rather than failing. A
# monitor run over a fleet whose peers have not synced yet, or whose
# host-facts collector has never run, is a run with less to say — never a
# failed one.

# The event names the union log carries that are worth their own class in
# the digest rather than being pooled into "everything else". Ordered by how
# often a reader wants them, not alphabetically: the first rows of the
# digest's own event table are the ones a monitor run opens on.
#
# Not a closed list: `monitor_digest_events` groups by whatever `event`
# values the window actually holds, so an event added upstream appears in the
# digest under its own name the day it is first written, with no edit here.
# This constant only fixes the *order* the known ones render in.

#
#   selections_by_source  which work bands actually produced a selection —
#                         the source-state count per band. Counted from the

#                         live gather, so it says what the fleet *did*, which

#                         report's second section asks.
#   fit_rungs             the Co-Ordinator input fit's rung histogram
#                         (`coordinator-input-fitted`). A rung climbing over
#                         a day is the signature of an input outgrowing its

#                         `fits: false` is counted separately because it is a
#                         different fact — the ladder ran out.
#   none_selected_reasons the day's `none-selected` reasons, verbatim and
#                         counted. `budget: 1` meaning a *negative* allowance
#                         (agent-ops#1128) was a sentence in one of these.
