#
# lib/merge-observed.sh — the completion path for a subject pull request that
# merges out from under a stage before that stage ever hands it off
# (agent-ops#916, escalation #922).
#
# `agent-cycle.sh`'s `$impl_pr_url` merging mid-Reviewer-pass used to go
# unnoticed: nothing on the handoff path ever asked GitHub whether the pull
# request it was about to flip ready, or approve, or land was still open, so
# a Reviewer that noticed had no contract for it and improvised — opening a
# replacement pull request reported only in prose, invisible to every
# machine-readable record the pipeline keeps (`pr-raised`, the `pr-<n>`
# claim, a `complexity:*` label, an Approver engagement). See lib/handoff.sh's
# `pr_merge_state` for the read that catches this; this file is what a
# confirmed merge does once caught.
#
# Escalation #922 settled three points this file and its callers in
# agent-cycle.sh (the Reviewer's own stage-start, advisory, and its handoff,
# fail-closed) divide between them:
#
#   1. The Reviewer may not open a replacement pull request when its subject
#      merges mid-pass. It stops — no further push anywhere, no replacement —
#      and ends `"status": "blocked"` naming the merge, with whatever it had
#      already found carried in `file_debt`/`file_issue` instead of a
#      `Defers:` line (there is no live pull request left to add one to).
#   2. A mid-stage merge is a completion, decided by the Script's own read —
#      never the Reviewer verdict's word, so this runs whether the Reviewer
#      never noticed (`"status": "ready"`) or noticed and said so
#      (`"status": "blocked"`). No `pr-ready`, no Approver engagement, no
#      landing attempt; the item retires the way `lib/work-gone.sh` retires
#      one whose issue closed underneath it, never as `attempt-failed`.
#   3. One state-read helper (`pr_merge_state`), fail-closed at the handoff
#      and advisory at each stage-start — the Reviewer's and, as of
#      requirement 31f, the Implementer's.
#
# Requirement 31f (agent-ops#1062) is what makes decision 3's "each
# stage-start" plural: a third, equally advisory caller at the Implementer's
# own stage-start, ahead of one of the five finishing sources whose work order
# already names a subject pull request (`preflight_existing_branch_source`) —
# the same cost optimisation the Reviewer's stage-start already pays for,
# generalised to the call site that can waste a whole engagement on it too.
#
# `reviewer_merge_observed` is decision 2 and the leftover-filing half of
# decision 1: it logs `merge-observed`, files whatever the Reviewer's own
# verdict (or, at the stage-start call site, nothing — the Reviewer never
# ran) asked for under the ordinary pipeline login — the Reviewer carries no
# App identity of its own, the same reason `lib/enabler.sh`'s own
# `file_debt`/`file_issue` handling always omits TOKEN too — and releases the
# PR-keyed claim. Sourced, never executed: it sets no shell options, because
# agent-cycle.sh runs under `set -euo pipefail`. Depends on `log_event`,
# `release_pr_claim` (lib/candidate-select.sh) and `techdebt_file_debt`/
# `techdebt_file_issue` (lib/tech-debt-file.sh), all already sourced by the
# time agent-cycle.sh can reach any of its three call sites.

# reviewer_merge_observed PR_URL MERGE_SHA REV_STATUS_JSON STAGE
#
# PR_URL is the subject that merged. MERGE_SHA is `pr_merge_state`'s own
# second field, logged when non-empty. REV_STATUS_JSON is the Reviewer's
# parsed final JSON at the Reviewer's own handoff call site, or `{}` at
# either stage-start call site (no stage ran yet, so there is nothing to
# have asked for). STAGE is `"reviewer"`, `"reviewer-stage-start"` or
# `"implementer-stage-start"`, carried on the `merge-observed` event so a
# reader can tell which read caught it.
