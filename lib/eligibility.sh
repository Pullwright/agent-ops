#
# lib/eligibility.sh — what this cycle is allowed to act on, once the
# gatherers have finished and before anything is offered to a model: which
# pre-fetched bands survive the blocked/void skip-lists (requirements 3t/3u),
# which repositories' issues the Enabler may be judged against (35a/35b), the
# Refiner's own two extra pre-fetched sources (3y), and the Refiner's
# candidate set (39a).
#
# Split out of agent-cycle.sh (#771). One seam rather than four files because
# the four blocks answer one question between them — who is eligible for what
# this cycle — over the same inputs (`ordered_repos_json`,
# `source_states_json`, `blocked_json`/`void_json`, `claimed_json`), in an
# order that matters: the Enabler's eligible set and the Refiner's candidate
# set are both computed from the extracts the band pass has just settled, so
# an Enabler engagement and a Refiner engagement in the same cycle can never
# disagree about what is already spoken for.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh only, and its four functions called once each, in
# place, from where this text used to sit. Like `run_standdown_checks`
# (lib/standdown.sh) they declare nothing `local` and read and write the
# cycle's own globals directly — `refinements_json`, `decisions_json`,
# `enabler_eligible_json`, `enabler_allowed`, `refiner_repos_json`,
# `refiner_candidates_json`, `refiner_allowed`, `open_issues_json`,
# `live_pr_refs_json`, `stale_enabler_refs_json`/`_n` — so each call is
# indistinguishable, to the
# rest of the cycle, from the inline block it replaces. Their bodies keep the
# original top-level indentation for the same reason `lib/candidate-gather.sh`
# does: these were never functions, and reformatting them would bury the move
# in whitespace.

# Deferred from step 3 for the same reason 2.2a's back-pressure decision and
# 3b's no-op fingerprint are deferred from their own numbers: the repo loop
# (section 3) attached each repo's pre-fetched bands, claim-filtered, before
# `blocked_json`/`void_json` existed to filter them further. Now that both
# are final — void_json has had every reconciliation pass and its own
# retirement applied — finish the job for every band the Script hands the
# Co-Ordinator whole: drop any entry this repo's own blocked or void record
# names, exactly as exclude_claimed_items already dropped claimed ones.
# `findings`, `review_feedback`, `abandoned_drafts`, `merge_conflicts`,
# `dequeued`, `landing_refusals`, `register_hygiene`, `human_visibility` and `tech_debt` all get the identical
# second pass `exclude_blocked_or_void_items` first gave `tech_debt` alone
# (issue #310) — there is nothing about that exclusion tech-debt-specific,
# only tech-debt was the band it was first proven on. Every band the repo
# entry carries is in this list but `issues`; a band added to that entry and
# not to this list would keep handing the Co-Ordinator blocked and void
# candidates it has no list left to check them against, which is why
# `test/cycle-state.test.sh` pins the list itself.
#
# `issues` gets its own, narrower pass
# below instead, via `exclude_blocked_or_void_issues`: unlike every other
# band, a blocked issue can carry fresh evidence requirement 18a obliges the
# Co-Ordinator to re-read live, so dropping it here — before that re-read can
# ever happen — would silently retire the mandatory re-check rather than
# apply it (see that function's own comment).
#
# What remains in each band after this block is the Script's own answer to
# "what could the Co-Ordinator actually select from this band" — open,
# unclaimed, unblocked (or, for `issues`, blocked-but-due-a-re-read), not
# void — with no per-item judgement left for it to apply, and no room for a
# verdict like "requires per-item evaluation against blocked/void/claimed
# records" to be true of any of them.

# for every PR still in any of those states; a SHA-scoped ref absent from them
# has been superseded (a newer push), resolved, or requeued, either way stale.
# Only refs shaped `pr-<n>-conflict-<sha>`/`pr-<n>-superseded-<sha>`/
# `pr-<n>-dequeued-<sha>`/`pr-<n>-abandoned-<sha>` are tested — the
# merge-conflicts gather mints the first two (requirement 3g), both scoped to
# the same head SHA, so both go stale the same way, and a refused supersession
# void is recorded blocked under the second (requirement 32a) exactly as a
# refused conflict void is under the first. `pr-<n>-dequeued-<sha>` (the
# gather-dequeued.sh gather, requirement 3z) goes stale the identical way: a
# fresh push (a fix, or anyone else's) or a re-queue mints no *new* ref this
# script would test — it simply stops appearing in `dequeued`, which is what
# "absent from the live set" already means. Every other blocked item kind (a
# tech-debt id, an issue number, a review-feedback round) has no such
# re-detectable "current" state to compare against, and
# `test` on a plain id or number simply never matches the pattern. A jq
# failure leaves the set unfiltered: this is a cost saving, never the
# correctness gate (the Enabler still voids a stale item it does reach).
# An *empty* live set and a *failed* derivation of one are opposite facts, and
# only the guard below keeps them apart. Empty-on-success is meaningful — no PR
# is in either state this cycle, so every SHA-scoped ref really is superseded or
# resolved — but a jq failure knows nothing about any PR, and feeding its result
# in as an empty set would mark every eligible conflict/abandoned ref stale and
# drop the lot: maximal filtering, the exact opposite of the unfiltered
# degradation the comment above and requirement 35e both promise. Failure alone
# yields the empty *string* (jq prints nothing to stdout on error, and prints
# `[]` at minimum on success), so testing for it skips the filter outright.
