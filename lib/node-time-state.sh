# lib/node-time-state.sh — the node time-state record (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md,
# D21 of docs/ROADMAP.md, issue #597, Phase 1's time account): a `node-state`
# transition event every time a node changes what it is doing, carrying the
# cause, so idleness is recorded with its reason at the moment it happens
# rather than inferred afterwards from an absence of cycles.
#
# One shaping/logging function pair, on the same terms lib/metering.sh's
# `metering_fields` and lib/rework.sh's `rework_fields` already are: every
# call site here already knows, from the check it just ran, which of the six
# states applies and (for four of them) which cause — this file only shapes
# that into the documented event and, for the pure fold, derives seconds per
# state from the events already logged. It never classifies, never reads a
# transcript, and never asks a model.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shell options are set here, matching every
# other lib/*.sh — the caller owns those.

# --- The closed cause vocabulary (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md) ---
#
# `node_time_state_for_cause CAUSE` maps one of the closed vocabulary's
# tokens to its state, as "STATE\tCAUSE\n" (cause echoed back verbatim, so a
# caller has one tuple to destructure regardless of which helper produced
# it). An unrecognised cause prints "\t\n" (both fields empty) — the caller's
# signal to skip logging a cause-bearing state at all rather than guess one.
# Every branch's own trailing newline is not decoration: a caller destructures
# this with `read -r a b < <(...)`, and `read` reports failure — a nonzero
# exit under this repository's own `set -e` — for a line with no terminating
# newline, however completely it still populated the variables. Every printf
# in this file keeps that newline for the same reason, whether or not the
# variables it fills are ever inspected by a caller that would notice.
#
# Two of the fifteen tokens are pre-existing `stand-down`/`claim-lost`
# causes this requirement does not rename (agent-ops#598's join-key
# precedent: an existing field's values are never renamed to satisfy a new
# reader) — `raced`/`pre-claimed` (claim-race stand-downs, agent-cycle.sh)
# and `untraceable` (a corroboration-gate stand-down) keep their own names on
# the `stand-down` event itself, and are translated here to the canonical
# `peer-claimed`/`coordinator-declined` tokens only for the `node-state`
# event this file emits alongside it.

# always read as "out of down" (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md), regardless of what a
# peer's log might say this node was doing under a different process a
# moment before. The fold itself never trusts `prev_state` for interval
# reconstruction — it re-derives every interval from consecutive events'

#
# The one case it exists for is a tick that found the *other* process holding
# the lock it wanted — `cycle-skipped`, `review-skipped`, and
# `review-cycle.sh`'s "an implementation cycle is running" stand-down. The
# refinement of issue #597 names it directly: "`cycle-skipped` is not a
# state. A tick that found the lock held means the node is busy in the other
# process, whose own events already own those seconds. Counting it as a state
# of its own is the same double-count by another route." Worse than a
# double-count, in fact: the fold holds each point's state until the *next*
# point's `ts`, and a running stage emits nothing between its own
# `stage-start` and `stage-end`, so one skipped tick's idle transition would
# relabel the rest of a live Implementer engagement — up to the backstop — as
# idle. Silence is the only reading that leaves the busy process's own record
# intact.
#
# Suppression covers the terminal transition only, because it is the only one
# these sites can still reach: the cycle-start/review-start transition is
# logged *after* the lock is won (`agent-cycle.sh`, `review-cycle.sh`), so a

# The pure fold (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md's "Node time-state record"). Reads
# `node-state` events only — every other event this requirement touches
# (`stand-down`, `none-selected`, `limit-hit`, …) already has its own
# `node-state` sibling logged beside it at the same instant, so the fold
# never has to re-derive a state from anything but this one event type.
#
# Per node: the timeline is a synthetic `down` point at the window's own
# start, followed by every one of that node's own `node-state` events inside
# the window, sorted by `ts`. Each point's own `state` holds from its `ts`
# until the next point's (the last, until the window's end) — so a node with
# zero events in the window scores `down` for the window's entire span (the
# synthetic point alone), and a node whose first event lands partway through
# the window scores `down` for the leading gap before it, exactly the
# "absent for part of the window" case this requirement's acceptance names.
# `prev_state` is never read here — every interval comes from consecutive
# points' own `ts`/`state`, which is also what makes this fold immune to two
# processes racing to log the same instant: whichever pipeline's own event
# actually carries the later `ts` simply starts the next interval, and
# nothing is double-counted, because a node contributes exactly one
# `window_seconds`-wide timeline no matter how many events land on it.
#
# One documented simplification (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md states it plainly
# rather than hiding it): the node set considered is every node that has
# *ever* logged a `node-state` event, over the fold's whole unwindowed input
# — not evaluated per second of the window the way a node truly joining or
# leaving the fleet mid-window would need. A decommissioned node keeps
# scoring `down` for the rest of the window after its last event, which
# overstates `down` for an installation that shrinks its fleet; a node that
# joins mid-window scores its own leading gap as `down` correctly (the
# general rule above already gives this one for free).
#
# An event naming no `node`, no `state`, or a `ts` that is missing or fails
# `fromdateiso8601` (not the strict %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ form) cannot be placed
# on any timeline at all and is excluded, counted under `skipped_events`
# rather than silently dropped. An event whose `state` is not one of the six
# names below cannot be classified either, but *can* still be placed — its
# own interval lands in `unaccounted_seconds` rather than being excluded,
# since the instant it names is real even though the label on it is not one
# the invariant recognises.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016  # jq's own $all/$since/$until, not the shell's.
