# lib/void-liveness.sh — the actioned signal for the void shapes requirement
# 34n's original two rules (a closed GitHub object, a resolved register row)
# never covered (TD-PPagop-26081303).
#
# Requirement 34n retires a void entry once it is both actioned and old, but
# "actioned" was only ever defined for the two shapes requirement 34k and the
# register-status read already act on. Every other shape a cycle can void —
# `dependabot-alert-<n>`/`code-scanning-alert-<n>`,
# `failed-run-<workflow>`, and `pr-<n>-conflict-<head-sha>` (later joined by
# its sibling shape `pr-<n>-superseded-<head-sha>`, TD-PPagop-26081304, by
# `pr-<n>-dequeued-<head-sha>`, TD-PPagop-26081409, and by
# `human-visibility-<hash>`, agent-ops#646) — had
# no actioned signal at all, so a void of one of those shapes never retired and
# the extract kept the same unbounded growth curve requirement 34n exists to
# stop, underneath the part it does bound.
#
# The decided direction (TD-PPagop-26081303, filed against PR #311's review):
# age-only retirement is rejected, because a void whose id is *still being
# gathered* — a still-open alert, a workflow still failing, a PR still
# conflicted or dequeued — is doing live suppression work every cycle, and
# retiring it on age alone re-exposes the item to be rediscovered void all
# over again (the exact churn requirement 34k exists to stop). The actioned
# analogue these five shapes have is liveness:
# the source that mints the id no longer yields it, this cycle, and the
# source's own gather succeeded — "unknown is not gone" (requirement 34i)
# applies here exactly as it does to the blocked set.
#
# Two other shapes a cycle can void — a project-review ref
# (`review-<date>-R-NN`) and an implementation-plan task id — are not
# pre-fetched as structured data at all; for those, requirement 34i's existing
# on-demand readers (`scripts/gather-review-status.sh`,
# `scripts/gather-plan-status.sh`) are the actioned signal, read for the void
# residue the same way they already are for the blocked one. The review ref
# shape carries a second, liveness-shaped signal alongside that reader
# (`review-superseded`, TD-PPagop-26082309): `review-merged` alone is defined
# only for a ref some merged pull request names, which a voided ref never is
# (it was voided because no Implementer ran), so `scripts/gather-project-
# review.sh --current-date` supplies the fact that reaches the rest — the
# review folder that minted the ref is no longer the repository's current
# one.
#
# `pr-<n>-landing-refusal-<ids>` (requirement 53, issue #979) has no liveness
# signal here, unlike its sibling finishing shapes above: a void of it would
# retire on requirement 34n's original age-only rule instead. Whether it
# should join the six — and by what test, since its ref is scoped to
# unreconciled comment ids rather than a head SHA — is the same deferred
# parity question issue #1481 tracks for this source's other finishing-shape
# machinery.
#
# A third rule sits alongside those two, for the residue neither can reach
# (PR #340 review, decided 2026-08-13): liveness decides nothing without the
# source's own successful gather, and a source is only gathered for a repo
# whose configured `sources` still list it — so a repo that drops
# `merge-conflicts` (or `security`) freezes every void
# of that shape it had already accumulated, and a repo dropped from the config
# altogether freezes every shape but the closed-object one. `void_config_
# actioned` reads that config fact directly. It is not a weakening of
# "unknown is not gone": that rule is about a *failed read*, which is
# indistinguishable from absence, whereas a source missing from `sources` is a
# definite fact the cycle reads locally for free — the pipeline is not
# uncertain whether the alert is still open, it has decided it will not look.
# What a void buys is suppression of a candidate the Co-Ordinator would
# otherwise be offered; an ungathered source offers nothing, so the void buys
# nothing and retiring it costs nothing.
#
# A void naming no repo at all (the hand-appended form requirement 34c allows)
# matches none of these shapes by construction — a repo-scoped GATHER_JSON
# lookup on an empty repo key finds nothing, and the config rule below skips it
# explicitly — so it is left, as it always was, for a human to retract.
#
# Sourced, never executed: it sets no shell options, because agent-cycle.sh
# runs under `set -euo pipefail`.

# The id shapes this file can decide, kept in one place for the same reason
# lib/work-gone.sh's own regexes are (requirement 34a): the classifier below
# and the Script, which asks each side-channel only about ids that could
# possibly be its shape, both need them to agree.
#
# The alert refs are minted by scripts/gather-findings.sh ("dependabot-alert-"
# / "code-scanning-alert-" + the alert number).
VOID_LIVENESS_ALERT_RE='^(dependabot|code-scanning)-alert-[0-9]+$'

# scripts/gather-human-visibility-hygiene.sh's own ref (agent-ops#646):
# `human-visibility-` plus a 12-hex-character sha256 of the surviving
# violations' own `pr_url|detail` pairs. A digest-over-a-set shape: note what
# makes an id absent here — the digest is scoped to *this* violation set, so a
# set that has merely changed mints a different ref rather than dropping this
# one, and the void of the old ref is dead weight from that moment on. Neither
# ref is ever re-offered once its set has moved, which is why the
# absent-from-the-gather test is sound despite the ref never repeating.
VOID_LIVENESS_HUMAN_VISIBILITY_RE='^human-visibility-[0-9a-f]{12}$'

# Requirement 19's `failed-runs` item id: `failed-run-` plus the workflow
# file's basename, without extension — free-form beyond that (a workflow
# filename may carry dots, underscores or hyphens).
VOID_LIVENESS_FAILED_RUN_RE='^failed-run-.+$'

# scripts/gather-merge-conflicts.sh's own two ref shapes, both scoped to a
# head SHA's leading 12 hex characters (`${head_sha:0:12}`): `pr-<n>-conflict-`,
# the shape requirement 34k deliberately excludes from its close (the addendum
# to TD-PPagop-26081303), and `pr-<n>-superseded-`, the shape a Dependabot
# supersession (requirement 3s) mints instead and that 34k *does* close
# (TD-PPagop-26081304). Both retire from the void extract the same way — this
# file's own absent-from-this-cycle's-gather test — and the superseded shape
# additionally earns a `void-object-closed` once 34k closes its pull request;
# the two signals coincide (a closed pull request also leaves the gather), so
# sharing one regex here is redundant-but-safe rather than a competing rule.
VOID_LIVENESS_MERGE_CONFLICT_RE='^pr-[0-9]+-(conflict|superseded)-[0-9a-f]{6,40}$'

# scripts/gather-dequeued.sh's own ref shape (TD-PPagop-26081409), scoped to
# a head SHA the same way: `pr-<n>-dequeued-<head-sha>`. It retires from the
# void extract by the same absent-from-this-cycle's-gather test the
# merge-conflict shapes use, since that script's candidate rule is re-read live
# each cycle — but note *what* makes it absent, which differs from the shapes
# above. A re-queue, a merge, a close or a draft ends the pull request's
# candidacy outright; the Implementer's own fix push does not, and is caught
# instead by that script's answered clause (its "Why the dequeue must still be
# unanswered" section). A push alone merely replaces this ref with one at the
# new head, which is why the clause and not the scoping is what stops the entry
# reappearing for ever.
VOID_LIVENESS_DEQUEUED_RE='^pr-[0-9]+-dequeued-[0-9a-f]{6,40}$'

# void_liveness_actioned VOID_JSON GATHER_JSON
# Print, as a JSON array of `{repo, item, by}`, the pairs from VOID_JSON that
# requirement 34n's liveness rule counts as actioned: an entry whose item
# matches one of the five shapes above, whose repo carries a GATHER_JSON entry
# for that shape with `ok: true`, and whose item is absent from that shape's
# `ids`.
#
# GATHER_JSON is keyed repo -> shape -> `{ok, ids}`, shape one of "alert",
# "failed-run", "merge-conflict", "dequeued",
# "human-visibility":
#
#   {"owner/repo": {"alert": {"ok": true, "ids": ["dependabot-alert-3"]},
#                    "failed-run": {"ok": false, "ids": []},
#                    "merge-conflict": {"ok": true, "ids": ["pr-9-conflict-1a2b3c4d5e6f"]},
#                    "dequeued": {"ok": true, "ids": []},
#                    "human-visibility": {"ok": true, "ids": []}}}
#
# `ids` is this cycle's own gather for that repo+shape — the same array (or
# the same source) the Co-Ordinator itself was handed, before any claim
# exclusion narrows it: a claimed alert is still an open one, and narrowing by
# claim status here would retire a void whose object never actually closed.
# `ok` is whether that gather succeeded this cycle; `false` (or the repo+shape
# entry being absent entirely) decides nothing, the same "unknown is not gone"
# rule requirement 34i's own clearances observe — an item present in
# GATHER_JSON with `ok: false` is exactly as undecided as a repo missing from
# it altogether.
#
# The caller builds GATHER_JSON however it can afford to; this function reads
# it and nothing else, so it needs no network access and stays a pure,
# testable transform over state the caller already holds.
#
# Both VOID_JSON and GATHER_JSON travel on stdin, never in argv (requirement
# 4g): VOID_JSON is the unbounded extract itself. Fails safe to `[]` on any
# malformed input — the same "never retiring is the safe direction" rule
# `retire_void_items` already observes for the age half of this decision.

#
# REVIEW_STATUS_JSON and PLAN_STATUS_JSON are the same shape

#
# REVIEW_CURRENT_JSON (TD-PPagop-26082309) is repo -> the repository's current

# a repo missing from this map is one whose `--current-date` read failed

# a definite fact, so every review ref in that repo is superseded. A review
# ref is actioned this way (`by: "review-superseded"`) when the repo has an
# entry here and the ref's own embedded date (the `YYYY-MM-DD` between
# `review-` and `-R-`) differs from it. This reaches the population
# `review-merged` cannot: a void'd review ref is voided precisely because no
# Implementer ran, so no merged pull request ever named it, and the
# `review-merged` signal alone leaves such an entry in the extract for ever.
# The reasoning is the same `void_config_actioned`'s `source-dropped` rule

# void_config_actioned VOID_JSON REPOS_JSON
# Print, as a JSON array of `{repo, item, by}`, the pairs the configuration
# itself retires, for the residue the two rules above cannot reach: an entry
# whose repo the config no longer names at all (`by: "repo-dropped"`), or
# whose item is shaped like a source's own id and whose repo no longer lists
# that source (`by: "source-dropped"`).
#
# REPOS_JSON is the configured repo array — `[{slug, sources: […]}, …]` — and
# it must be the **unnarrowed** one (`all_repos_json`, straight off
# `cfg_json '.repos'`). Two things narrow that array later in a cycle and
# neither means what this rule reads it as: `--repo`'s own filter, which
# would make every other repo read as dropped, and back-pressure, which
# rewrites `sources` down to the four finishing sources for a repo with work
# waiting and would mint a spurious `source-dropped` for `security`
# on every back-pressured cycle.
#
# The shape -> source map is the inverse of the repo walk's own gating: each
# shape is minted by exactly one gather, and that gather runs only for a repo
# whose `sources` list the entry named here. The alert shape is the one with
# two, because `scripts/gather-findings.sh` serves `security` and
# `code-quality` together — either alone keeps its voids live.
#
# Deliberately scoped to the shapes whose id *form* names the source that
# mints them. A bare issue number or a `pr-<n>-…` shaped neither `-conflict-`
# nor `-superseded-` is offered by several sources (`issues:<band>`,
# `review-feedback`, `abandoned-drafts`), so no such
# inverse exists and no `source-dropped` verdict can be read off the id —
# those keep the closed-object signal they already had. `human-visibility` is
# not among them, though it was named here until agent-ops#646: it mints
# exactly one id shape, its own `human-visibility-<hash>` ref (the `hv_cands`
# arm of agent-cycle.sh's candidate build passes `.ref` through, never a pull
# request number), so the inverse is as well defined for it as for the four
# above and the shape belongs in the map. The `repo-dropped`
# half needs no map at all and so applies to
# every shape: nothing in a repo the config does not name can be offered by
# any source.
#
# Fails safe to `[]`: on malformed input, and — the case worth naming — on a

# "every repo has been dropped" and retire the whole extract at once.
