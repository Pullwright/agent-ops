# lib/report-directory.sh — resolving a configurable `report_directory` (issue
# #761): a GNU date(1) format string naming where the review pipeline writes
# its report set, and discovering which of its past instances already exist
# on a repository's default branch.
#
# `date -u +"<format>"` answers "where does today's report go" in one call —
# that part needs no help. What this file adds is the other direction: "which
# directories matching this format's shape already exist, and which is the
# most recent". A fixed layout (`reviews/project-review-YYYY-MM-DD`) used to
# answer that with one hardcoded regex; a configurable format string cannot,
# because the date component can sit anywhere in the path (an installation's
# override may template a whole leading segment, e.g. `%Y/repo-review`) and
# the surrounding literal text is arbitrary.
#
# ## Design: list once, then test days locally
#
# `report_directory_find_dirs` turns FORMAT into a small set of *existing*
# candidate directories with one targeted GitHub listing (occasionally a
# few, for a format with more than one dynamic path segment) — every leading
# segment free of a `%` specifier is folded into a single static path prefix
# first, so the common case (the whole dynamic part is the final segment, as
# both the shipped default and every example in the issue are shaped) costs
# exactly the one listing call the fixed layout already made.
#
# `report_directory_most_recent` then finds which day each candidate belongs
# to not by parsing the candidate's name back into a date (which would need a
# second, position-tracking regex, one considerably fiddlier to get right for
# an arbitrary format), but by resolving FORMAT for each of the last LOOKBACK
# days and checking whether that resolved string is one of the candidates.
# Every one of those checks is a local `date` call — no network cost beyond
# the listing above — so a generous lookback (400 days; comfortably longer
# than any realistic gap between reviews) costs nothing worth economising.

# The report directory's own ultimate fallback (issue #761): used by both
# pipelines wherever a repository configures neither its own
# `repository_review.repos[].report_directory` nor
# `repository_review.defaults.report_directory` — today's layout, unchanged. Not
# a schema `default` (config.schema.json's `reportDirectory` $def
# deliberately carries none): a schema-level default would be injected by
# config_defaults and read as a configured override, permanently hiding the
# distinction between "genuinely unset" and "set to this value" that
# render-config-table.sh's "*(unset)*" cells depend on.

# report_directory_regex FORMAT
# A POSIX ERE fragment (no anchors) matching any string `date -u +FORMAT`
# could produce. Recognises the specifiers a report-directory format
# plausibly uses — %Y %y %m %d %H %M %S %j, and %% for a literal percent —
# converting each to a digit-count character class; every other character is
# regex-escaped if it is a metacharacter, copied through otherwise. A
# specifier this does not recognise degrades to `.*` (still matches, just
# without narrowing what it matches), never to a hard failure — the
# directories such a format is producing are exactly the ones this must
# still be able to find.
