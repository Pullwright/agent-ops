# lib/updater-health.sh — has the update mechanism itself gone wrong, ahead of
# and independent of the drift it eventually causes?
#
# On 2026-08-14 watchtower on poetic-vm-1 tried to create two replacement
# containers it had never stopped, hit a name collision, and logged
# `Session done Failed=2` on every poll thereafter while the node stayed on
# the previous image — through a fleet roll carrying a fix the other three
# nodes had already taken. Nothing raised it: the node was healthy by every
# definition it had (agent-ops#603). `lib/image-drift.sh` deliberately
# tolerates `image_behind_grace_hours` of lag, because a roll waiting on a
# cycle already in flight is routine — but a roll watchtower has stopped even
# attempting is not drift at all, and would not have cleared on its own: the
# retry repeats the operation that collides.
#
# Nothing inside a container can read watchtower's log or the Docker socket
# (neither exists here, by design), so the one fact this side of the fence
# can ever learn is what `deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh` itself
# decided — which it records, one line per invocation, in a durable ledger
# under `state_dir` (`updater-ledger/<hostname>.jsonl`). `$HOSTNAME` tells a
# tailnet node's scheduler and dashboard containers apart — they share this
# state volume but not an identity — but it does not tell one *generation* of
# the same service from the next: watchtower clones `Config.Hostname` forward
# when it recreates a container (agent-ops#1072), so a roll's replacement
# inherits its predecessor's hostname and keeps appending to the very same
# file. Each line therefore also carries `started` — the *writing*
# container's own PID 1 start time, in clock ticks since the host booted
# (field 22 of `/proc/1/stat`; see `_updater_health_own_started` below for
# why neither `/proc/uptime` nor `stat -c %Y /proc/1` can serve), `null` when
# unreadable — the one field two lines in the same file can disagree on
# across a roll, and so the only thing that can answer "did the container
# reading this line write it?" Each line also carries
# `service` — the compose service name (`AGENT_OPS_SERVICE`: `scheduler`,
# `dashboard`, `dashboard-local`, `collector` or `reconciler`) the writing
# container ran as, `"unknown"` when unset. `updater_status` reads that ledger back and answers one of:
#
#   {status:"rolled", at, seconds}
#     the newest "allow" invocation this ledger can show was *not* written by
#     the container now reading it — either under a different hostname
#     entirely (from our own service, the ordinary post-roll case: no ledger
#     entry yet exists under this container's own name), or under this
#     container's own hostname file, but its trailing "allow" carries a
#     `started` different from this container's own: the roll that produced
#     this very container (agent-ops#1072), not evidence that it never
#     happened.
#   {status:"deferring", at, seconds}
#     our own most recent invocation deferred (EX_TEMPFAIL), every invocation
#     before it back to `at` did too, and that streak has not yet outlasted
#     what any lock this hook honours could legitimately hold — how long the
#     hook has been protecting a cycle in flight.
#   {status:"stuck", at, seconds, reason}
#     a fault only a human clears, either because (`reason:"allow"`) our own
#     most recent invocation allowed the roll — proven by `started` matching
#     this container's own, never by the hostname alone (agent-ops#1072) —
#     every invocation of that same generation back to `at` did too, and
#     `seconds` (now minus `at`) has already reached <stuck-after-seconds>
#     with this exact container still the one running; or because
#     (`reason:"defer"`) the defer streak above has itself outlasted
#     <defer-stuck-after-seconds>, past which no lock this hook honours could
#     still be legitimately held, so this is no longer "a cycle in flight".
#   null
#     no watchtower has ever polled this container (no ledger entry under
#     any hostname at all), our own newest entry is already older than
#     <stuck-after-seconds> (see "Liveness first" below), the most recent
#     "allow" from our own service anywhere already belongs to us with less
#     than <stuck-after-seconds> elapsed — too recent to call either "rolled"
#     or "stuck" yet — or the trailing entry under our own hostname carries no
#     `started` at all, or this container cannot read its own, so no identity
#     verdict is possible on the strength of that entry, in either direction
#     (agent-ops#1072). Never returns non-zero and never asserts a verdict
#     the ledger cannot support:
#     this runs under `set -e` inside a heartbeat push, and an unanswerable
#     question is not a reason to abort one. A threshold that is not a whole
#     number of seconds, or a timestamp this file cannot parse, is one such
#     unanswerable question, and reads null (or, mid-streak, ends the streak
#     there) rather than guessing at a value this file has no business
#     choosing. Guessing is the one thing this file must never do with a
#     malformed timestamp: unlike `held_by()` in watchtower-pre-update.sh,
#     where an unparseable `started_at` reading as epoch 0 fails the lock
#     *open* (not honoured), the same convention here would fail *closed* —
#     into a "stuck"/"deferring" alarm nothing could ever clear, since a
#     corrupt line's own string timestamp can also defeat the hook's 48h
#     trim. So a timestamp this file cannot parse supports no verdict at all.
#
# Both of the states this container can be in for itself are *streaks*, not
# moments, and are measured from the streak's start. watchtower re-runs the
# hook on every poll for as long as the container is still stale — the hook's
# own header records `Failed=3 Scanned=3 Updated=0` "every five minutes for
# hours", and "each poll is answered independently" — so a container that is
# deferring, and equally one that allowed a roll that never happened, appends
# one entry per poll. Reading only the newest would measure the age of the
# last poll (under one `WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL`, 300s by default) rather
# than the age of the condition, and `stuck` — whose threshold is minutes of
# polls, not one — could then never be reached at all. A line that will not
# parse, mid-streak, is skipped rather than treated as ending the streak: one
# transient bad line must not silence an alarm four polls early, or reset the
# clock on a stuck container that has been running for hours.
#
# The `allow` streak scan is bounded by `started` as well as by verdict: the
# unbroken run stops the moment `started` changes, not only when the verdict
# does. Without that, a container watchtower rolls repeatedly inside
# <stuck-after-seconds> — each roll's replacement appending its own genuine
# "allow" under the one hostname every replacement inherits — would read as
# one continuous streak spanning several *successful* rolls, `stuck` while
# everything is working (agent-ops#1072). The `defer` streak needs no such
# bound: the entry immediately before any roll is always an "allow" (that is
# what authorises the roll), so a defer streak can never itself straddle a
# generation boundary — the ordinary verdict-mismatch break already stops it
# there.
#
# Liveness first (agent-ops#1071, deciding agent-ops#1053): before either
# streak above is even read, our own hostname's newest entry — whatever its
# verdict — must itself be no older than <stuck-after-seconds>, or this
# returns null outright. Both self-states are claims about the present, and a
# ledger nothing has appended to in that long no longer supports one, however
# long the streak underneath it runs: a node whose watchtower stopped
# polling after one last "allow" (TD-PPagop-26082913) and a node genuinely
# stuck since that same "allow" are indistinguishable from the ledger alone
# once the newest line itself has gone that stale, so both get the same
# unanswerable reading rather than the first reading as a permanent, human-
# unclearable alarm. One gate, the same threshold that already bounds the
# `allow` streak — no second number for siblings. `rolled` below is exempt:
# it is a claim about the past, already carries its own age in `seconds`, and
# keeps the hook's 7-day prune as its only bound.
#
# <stuck-after-seconds> is the caller's, not a literal here — the same shape
# `image_behind_grace_hours` already uses one layer up (config.schema.json's
# `updater_stuck_after_minutes`, read and converted by the caller) — so this
# file carries no config-reading of its own and no default that could drift
# from the schema's. <defer-stuck-after-seconds> is the caller's on the same
# terms: the natural bound on a legitimate defer streak is the longer of
# `lock_stale_after` and `repository_review.lock_stale_after`, since past that
# point watchtower-pre-update.sh's own `held_by()` would no longer honour
# either lock — the caller derives it, this file only applies it.
#
# The "rolled" fallback scan is restricted to ledger entries carrying the
# same `service` this container itself runs as (passed in, since a fresh
# container has no ledger entry of its own to read one back from). Without
# that, a stuck sibling *of a different service* sharing this ledger
# directory — the scheduler and the dashboard mount the same state volume
# but are different services — keeps appending fresh "allow" entries every
# poll, and its ever-newer timestamp wins the "newest allow anywhere" scan
# even though it has nothing to do with why this container exists. Two
# containers of the *same* service never coexist (one replaces the other),
# so same-service filtering is exactly the scope that fallback needs.

# _updater_health_epoch TS — epoch seconds for TS on stdout, or nothing with
# a non-zero exit if TS cannot be parsed. The one place this file turns a
# timestamp into a number; every caller must treat a non-zero exit as "this
# entry supports no verdict", never default to epoch 0 (see the header).

# present needs an entry recent enough to still describe it (see the header's
# "Liveness first"). False — never a crash — for an unparseable TS or a
# STUCK-AFTER-SECONDS that is not a whole number of seconds too: neither
# supports an answer, and "no answer" is not liveness. A property of a file,
# not of a service — identical for this container's own ledger and any

# _updater_health_own_started — this container's own PID 1 start time, in

# `deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh`'s `pid1_started` stamps into every
# ledger line it writes — this file runs inside the very same container whose
# ledger it reads back (state-sync.sh's and publish-dashboard.sh's own
# heartbeat pushes), so asking the question identically is what makes the two
# comparable at all. Split on the *last* `") "`: field 2 is the executable's

# remaining fields start at field 3, so field 22 is index 19.
#
# Two nearer-to-hand readings are deliberately not used. `/proc/uptime` is the
# *host's* uptime under Docker, not this container's, so it would read the
# same in every generation. And `stat -c %Y /proc/1` is the procfs inode's
# mtime, which the kernel sets when that inode is *instantiated* — the first
# lookup after a cache miss — rather than when the process started; it is a
# property of access history, not of the process, and moves whenever the
# dentry is reclaimed and looked up afresh (measured on poetic-1: it read
# 2h25m later than PID 1's real start). An identity that can change under one
# container fails exactly one way — the reader stops recognising entries it
# wrote itself and reads `rolled` — which silently retires the `stuck` alarm
# this whole file exists to raise. Field 22 is fixed for the life of the
# process, and strictly ordered across generations, since a replacement
# always starts after what it replaced.

# the file. A line that will not parse is skipped — neither extending the
# streak nor ending it, since it supports neither reading. LAST-TS — the last
# line's own timestamp — is the answer when the run is one entry long. See
# the header: both self-states are streaks, and reading only the newest entry
# would time the last poll rather than the condition.
#
# WANT-STARTED, when given, additionally stops the streak the moment an
# entry's own `started` differs from it — an entry with no `started` at all
# stops it too, on the same "no identity verdict" reasoning as the caller's
# own check on the trailing entry (agent-ops#1072): without this, a run of
# same-verdict "allow"s spanning several genuine rolls under one inherited
