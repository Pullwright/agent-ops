# lib/review-context.sh — per-repository instructions and context for the
# Reviewer-Agent (issue #589, D7 in docs/ROADMAP.md).
#
# The decision recorded on that issue, restated here because it is what this
# file implements: **both layered, configuration winning** — a repository's
# own resolved `review_instructions`/`review_context` (its override, or
# `repository_review.defaults`', requirement 342) hold installation-supplied
# text; `repo_context_file` additionally admits one file read from the
# repository under review's own clone, but *only* as context, never as
# instruction. The reasoning is D19's: text a reviewed repository's
# contributors can edit is trustworthy only as far as a pull request into
# that repository is, so anything that changes how *strictly* a review
# judges must live in the installation's own configuration, never in the
# repository it is judging.
#
# `review_instructions`/`review_context` paths are resolved against
# `state_dir`, on the same terms as `lib/prompt-overrides.sh`'s `extend` —
# but deliberately do not share that file's tolerance for a missing path.
# `prompt_overrides` treats an unreadable configured file as absent, because
# it is guidance a stage can simply run without; these paths are read
# instead, because a silently-dropped `review_instructions` entry would look
# like a review that quietly stopped weighing what an operator configured it
# to weigh. `review_context_missing_configured` is the shared check
# review-cycle.sh (fail-fast, before the lock) and scripts/doctor.sh (a
# `fail`, not a `warn`) both call, so the two can never disagree about what
# counts as a broken path.
#
# Sourced by review-cycle.sh and scripts/doctor.sh.

# A generous bound on one source's contribution to the runtime input — large
# enough for any genuine instructions/context document, small enough that a
# runaway or mistakenly-pointed file cannot blow out the reviewer's prompt.
# Not configurable: the issue that added this facility asked for a cap and a
# truncation warning, not a tunable, and one fixed value is one fewer thing
# to get wrong in `config.json`.

# review_context_resolve_path BASE RAW
# Expands a leading ~ against $HOME, then resolves a still-relative path
# against BASE. Identical in shape to lib/prompt-overrides.sh's
# resolve_prompt_override_path, kept as a separate small copy rather than a
# cross-file call: that file is product content for the implementation
# pipeline's prompt overrides (issue #79), and this facility is deliberately
# out of scope for it (issue #589's "out of scope" list) — not a dependency
# to introduce for three lines of path arithmetic. Prints nothing for an
# empty RAW.
