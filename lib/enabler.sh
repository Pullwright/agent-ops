# GitHub issue the Script then files, assigned, saying exactly what to do.
#
# Everything below is best-effort by construction, because it runs from the exit
# trap (see `cleanup`). A non-zero status escaping any of it would abandon the
# trap part-way and cost the cycle its `cycle-end` event, its lock release and
# its state-sync push — the Enabler failing must never look like the cycle
# failing (requirement 37). So every substitution is guarded, every `gh` call
# tolerates failure, and the whole thing is invoked as `… || true`.

#
# `notify_post_cycle`'s own no-op/rate-limit/best-effort rules apply

#
#   - A duplicate guard. An open issue carrying the escalation label whose body
#     already quotes this item's reference *is* the escalation — return it
#     rather than filing a second one at the same human. The item ref in the
#     issue footer (prompts/enabler.md) is what makes this findable, and the
#     body check is what stops a bare number matching an unrelated escalation.
#   - The create carries the label *and* the assignee. The assignee is the
#     load-bearing half: assignment is what excludes an issue from the `issues`
#     work source (requirement 16.4), so the pipeline can never select its own
#     request for help as work. The label is for the human's filter and the
#     guard above.
#   - One retry without the label, because a repo where the label has not been
#     created yet must still get its issue. Losing the label costs a filter;
#     losing the issue costs the escalation.
#
# A fresh create (never the duplicate-guard path) also posts `escalation-filed`
# on the installation's notify channel (`notify_post_cycle`, lib/notify.sh,
# issue #1279); a failed create posts `escalation-unfiled` via

# create_decision_log_issue REPO ITEM LABEL TITLE BODY_FILE REASON_KEY
# File one decision-log issue (agent-ops#937): the durable record of a
# `decide-tactical` `decide` verdict, filed closed and unassigned — a log, not
# an ask. Prints "<number>\t<url>"; prints nothing and returns 1 if it could
# not be filed. Mirrors `create_escalation_issue` above, with five
# differences that follow from being a log rather than a request:
#
#   - The duplicate guard searches `--state all`, not `--state open`: the log
#     issue is filed closed and *stays* closed until a human vetoes it by
#     reopening it, so "already filed" must match regardless of its current
#     state. Reusing the same body-footer item ref `create_escalation_issue`
#     keys its own guard on (agent-ops#937's own instruction) means the two
#     dedup guards find exactly the same set of issues for the same item —
#     but REASON_KEY narrows the match further: an item ref alone matches
#     *every* decision this item has ever carried, so without this a second,
#     legitimate decide verdict over a distinct reason_key (permitted —
#     `escalation_autonomy_decide_pass_available` bounds by reason, not by
#     item) would silently reuse the first decision's own closed issue rather
#     than filing a fresh one (agent-ops#1198, review round 2): its body would
#     go on showing decision #1's text while decision #2 is the decision of
#     record, `decision_vetoes_processed_items` would already hold that issue
#     number from decision #1's own veto history (if any) and refuse to
#     process a second one, and the whole premise
#     `decision_vetoes_processed_items`'s own header states — "a re-decide
#     arrives under a fresh log issue" — would not hold. REASON_KEY is
#     matched against the same `reason_key=` marker
#     `enabler_decision_log_body` embeds, empty matching any body (no
#     narrowing) the way an absent value always has here.
#   - No `--assignee`: an assigned issue is a request the human closes when
#     done; this is a record veto by reopening, not by any hand-applied
#     assignee, and an assignee here would only exclude it from the `issues`
#     source for no reason (requirement 16.4's assignment exclusion has
#     nothing to key off, since nobody is meant to work this issue).
#   - Filed open (the API has no other option) and immediately closed. A
#     close failure is reported as a warning by the caller, not by returning
#     1 here — the log issue exists and carries the decision either way; an
#     unclosed one only costs the human seeing it briefly on an
#     open-issue-labelled filter before the next cycle's sweep or a human
#     closes it by hand.
#   - No retry without the label on a failed create. `create_escalation_issue`
#     accepts that trade for an ordinary escalation, where the label is only a
#     human's own filter and the issue's assignee is what actually excludes it
#     from the `issues` source — losing the label there costs nothing this
#     system depends on. Here the label *is* the mechanism:
#     `scripts/sweep-decision-vetoes.sh` finds every log issue to check for a
#     veto by searching `pw::decision`, and this function's own duplicate guard
#     above searches the same label — an issue filed without it is invisible
#     to both, a veto lever dead from the moment it is filed, and a later
#     `decide-tactical` pass for the same item would file a second log issue
#     never knowing this one existed (agent-ops#1198). `labels_ensure_role`
#     just above already makes the label likely before the one create attempt
#     this function makes; a create that still fails is a genuine failure,
#     reported by the caller's own warning (see requirement 37) exactly as a
#     missing URL or issue number already is below, never silently retried
#     into a record the rest of this feature can never find again.

will clear it, and until it clears the fleet selects no work at all.

# attempt (if any) has run.
#
# A FRESH verdict — nothing has ever tried to file this exact run before
# (`crash_loop_deferred_since` finds no prior attempt) — is filed here,
# immediately, exactly as `crash_loop_escalate` always has: at this point in
# the cycle the verdict is as current as it has ever been, since no earlier
# attempt existed to have gone stale.
#
# A DEFERRED RETRY — a previous cycle already tried and failed to file this
# exact run — is not filed here at all. The verdict computed at this point in
# *this* cycle is exactly as stale as the one a previous cycle already
# failed to file: it was gathered before this cycle's own Co-Ordinator has
# had its chance, so it can never see a recovery that attempt is about to
# produce. Filing it here is what turned the 2026-08-29/30 Ockham outage's
# last hour into a false alarm (agent-ops#1070): the escalation and the
# success that refuted it landed in the same cycle, the escalation first
# only because this block runs before the Co-Ordinator does.

# crash_loop_retire_resolved UNION_LOG_HORIZON
# Closes any open crash-loop escalation whose run has since broken *and*
# whose breaking Co-Ordinator success can be named — both conditions, since
# the detector going quiet alone is not evidence of recovery (see the
# `success_ts` guard below) — the Co-Ordinator class only (`stage:
# "coordinator"`, agent-ops#1074);
# `crash_loop_preselection_verdict`'s own class has no single resetting
# event `crash_loop_last_success_since` can name for the closing comment (a
# clean cycle exit and a selection-path stage-start both reset it), and
# nothing in the issue this exists for asked for that class's retirement.
#
# Runs from step 1b, against this cycle's ordinary start-of-cycle
# `$union_log`: unlike a deferred filing, retirement has no same-cycle race
# to lose to — an open issue's run either broke some earlier cycle (visible
# in any union snapshot since) or it did not, so the freshest-available
# snapshot serves exactly as well as one gathered later would. UNION_LOG_HORIZON
# is `$union_log`'s own requirement-39f horizon (`log_latest_ts`), passed in
# rather than read as a global the way every other library that needs it
# already takes it (lib/label-marker.sh, lib/candidate-gather.sh) — the
# newest `.ts` the snapshot reaches, used below as this function's own
# deterministic stand-in for "now".
#
# Before touching any open escalation, this also checks whether the same
# `$union_log` already shows a *fresh* Co-Ordinator run, in that escalation's
# own repository (agent-ops#1630 — `crash_loop_verdict` groups by `repo`, so
# this recompute is filtered to the entry's own group), under the very same
# detail — regardless of that run's own `first_ts` — and skips retirement
# outright if so (agent-ops#1134 review). `crash_loop_reverify` below already
# refuses to retire the *exact* run an open issue names; it cannot see a
# *new* run that has since re-crossed `crash_loop_after` under the same
# detail, because that new run has a different `first_ts` and so reads as a
# different run to a same-first_ts match. Step 1b in agent-cycle.sh now runs
# this function before either `crash_loop_escalate_or_defer` call, which closes the
# single-cycle, single-node version of that gap — but a peer node can still
# have escalated (and so rebound the still-open issue to) that new run in an
# earlier cycle whose own rebind event has not yet reached this node's
# peer-synced union. Without this check, this node would then retire the
# issue the peer just rebound, on the strength of a union snapshot that is
# stale only about the rebind, not about the new run's failures themselves —
# which this same snapshot already shows.
#
# Two more guards, added for the 2026-09-05 fleet flap: six escalations in
# four hours, every one the same detail, each retired within minutes of a
# lone fleet-wide Co-Ordinator success — one node's own cycle succeeding
# once — before that same detail resumed failing and re-crossed
# `crash_loop_after` as a "new" run a few cycles later. The guards above
# cannot see this coming: `active_detail` only fires once the new run has
# itself re-crossed threshold, and the ramp from a lone success back to
# threshold-many fresh failures took as little as two minutes of fleet time
# — nowhere near enough for `crash_loop_reverify`'s per-cycle recompute to
# catch it first. Retiring the issue the instant a clearing success is found
# is what let each flap open a fresh issue: `create_escalation_issue`'s own
# open-issue dedup is a live query with nothing still open left to find.
#
#   - `crash_loop_detail_recurred_since` — the same detail has already
#     resumed failing, in this very `$union_log`, at or after the clearing
#     success, whether or not it has reached threshold again. Unconditional,
#     not a tunable: retiring while the log in hand already contradicts the
#     "it broke" comment the issue is about to be closed with is the
#     mistake requirement 2.7's "silence must never retire an alarm" was
#     always written against, just from the other side of the ledger.
#   - `crash_loop_min_clear_minutes` — the clearing success itself must be
#     at least this many minutes older than UNION_LOG_HORIZON before it is
#     trusted, giving a same-detail recurrence that has not yet synced to
#     this node's own union time to arrive and trip the guard above instead.
#     `0` restores the previous instant-retirement behaviour.
#
# Together these turn a flapping incident into one issue that stays open,
# rebound (and re-logged with the flap's own new `detail`-unchanged,
# `first_ts`-fresh `crash-loop-escalated` event, agent-ops#1140) across
# every recurrence inside the window, rather than a fresh one per flap.

# run_enabler_decide REPO ITEM CLAIMED_ENTRY_JSON EX_JSON CYCLE_DIR IDX [MANDATE]
# One bounded decide-tactical pass (agent-ops#936, D18 pattern,
# `escalation_autonomy: "decide-tactical"`): before the Script files the
# escalation issue for *any* `escalate` verdict — not only a refinement
# disagreement, `run_enabler_adjudication`'s own narrower scope — ask a fresh,
# narrower Enabler engagement, over this one item alone, whether the item can
# be settled, decided tactically, or genuinely needs a person. Mirrors
# `run_enabler_adjudication` in shape and runs at the same tier
# (`enabler_model_critical`, falling back to `enabler_model`).
#
# MANDATE is `tactical` at `decide-tactical` and `delegate` at
# `decide-with-veto` (requirement 36f), and reaches the pass verbatim as the
# input's own `mandate` field: it is what tells the pass which of the two
# reaches the delegate mandate adds — condition 2's acceptance clause, and
# the human corroboration of a void — are open to it this run. Only the
# delegate mandate may return an `act`, and this function is where that is
# enforced rather than in the caller, so every refusal reads the same way an
# unreadable verdict does (below) whichever rung produced it.
#
# Prints `{"verdict": "settle"|"decide"|"escalate", "evidence": "...",
# "decision": "...", "rationale": "...", "options_considered": "...",
# "act": {...}}` on stdout. A missing prompt file, a stage failure, or an
# unparseable verdict all print `escalate` with an `evidence` string naming
# why — "cannot settle" reads the same way the Approver's own adjudication
# reads it: not as "nothing wrong" (requirement 8c).
