# lib/review-gate.sh — script-side confirmation, independent of what a
# Reviewer's own model says, that a pull request is genuinely safe to hand to
# a human as ready for review (requirement 31c, agent-ops#249).
#
# poetic-fiddle #216 reached `reviewDecision: APPROVED` while a CodeQL
# high-severity alert ("clear-text logging of sensitive information") sat
# open, hidden inside an otherwise 15/16-green check list. The Reviewer's own
# prompt already tells it to confirm CI is green before handing off
# (prompts/reviewer.md step 6), but that is a model reading a check list and
# judging it — exactly the judgement that missed this one. `lib/handoff.sh`
# already carries the fix for the same class of problem one step later (did
# the draft flip actually happen?); this file is the fix for the step before
# it — is this pull request's current state actually clean? — asked of
# GitHub rather than trusted from a report.
#
# Two things gate the handoff, both read fresh at the moment of the decision
# rather than reused from anything read earlier in the same engagement, so a
# check still catching up to a fix just pushed is never mistaken for a check
# that passed:
#
#   - every required status check is green at the pull request's current head
#     commit (`review_gate_required_checks`, `gh pr checks --required`);
#   - no code-scanning alert carrying a security severity exists on the pull
#     request's branch that does not already sit open on the base branch too
#     (`review_gate_security_alerts`) — a base branch that already lives with
#     an accepted alert must not freeze every future pull request over debt
#     that isn't theirs, so the base branch's own open alerts are subtracted
#     before anything is judged "introduced by this pull request".
#
# Both fail closed on an empty or unreadable required-check list rather than
# reading silence as "nothing wrong": poetic-fiddle #190, a CONFLICTING pull
# request, reports *no* required checks at all, which a plain "every check
# that ran was green" test over an empty list satisfies vacuously — the
# conflicting-PR-runs-no-CI trap this file's caller must not fall into.
#
# `review_gate_required_checks` still tells its own two failure shapes apart
# (TD-PPagop-26081305, agent-ops#327's review): a required check that is
# genuinely failing, or a pull request with no required checks at all (the
# trap above), are findings about the pull request and stay `dirty`; `gh pr
# checks --required` failing to answer at all — a 502, a transient auth
# failure, a rate limit — is a fact about this node or GitHub's availability,
# and is reported `unknown` instead. That `unknown` still refuses the handoff,
# signalled by a non-zero exit unlike the two `unknown`s below: a node whose
# `gh` cannot be trusted must not be read as "nothing wrong" merely because
# "wrong" could not be confirmed either. The distinction exists so the caller
# can log a node-level warning naming what could not be read, instead of a
# pull-request-shaped complaint that names nothing to fix.
#
# The two are told apart by `gh`'s **stderr**, not by the shape of its stdout,
# because `gh` reports "this pull request has no required checks" as an error
# and not as an empty list: `populateStatusChecks` returns
# `no required checks reported on the '<branch>' branch` (or `no checks
# reported…`, when nothing ran at all) and `checksRun` returns that before it
# ever writes the `--json` payload, so #190's trap arrives with empty stdout
# and a non-zero exit — byte-for-byte what a 502 looks like. Splitting on
# stdout alone would file every conflicting pull request as a degraded node,
# which is this item's own misattribution pointed the other way. An empty
# `[]` is still read as the trap if a future `gh` ever emits one, and any
# unrecognised diagnosis falls to `unknown`: both words refuse the handoff, so
# a reworded message costs attribution, never safety.
#
# `review_gate_security_alerts` is a different exception, and only for the
# specific failure "the alerts API could not be asked at all" (no
# `security_events` permission on this token, code scanning not enabled on
# the repository, GitHub unreachable): that is a fact about this node or this
# repository, not about the pull request, and blocking every handoff on it
# forever would trade one hazard for a worse one — the same reasoning
# scripts/preview-deploy.sh already applies to a Vercel preview it cannot
# reach. `review_gate_verdict` reports that case as `unknown` too, but exits
# 0: a caller must say so rather than certifying a check that was never
# actually made, but need not refuse the handoff over it. The two `unknown`s
# are told apart by `review_gate_verdict`'s own exit status, not by the word
# alone — see its own header.
#
# `review_gate_unknown_streak_verdict` (TD-PPagop-26081404) is the follow-up
# to the node-level `warning` above: a `gh` degraded enough to fail the
# required-checks read rarely fails it only once, so it turns a run of
# consecutive per-node failures into one louder escalation event instead of
# one warning per item — see its own header for how it reuses
# `lib/crash-loop.sh`'s shape. `review_gate_degraded_since` is its dedup
# companion, answering "has this run already had its one loud event?" the
# way `crash_loop_escalated_since` does for requirement 2.7's crash loop.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shell options are set here, matching every
# other lib/*.sh — the caller (agent-cycle.sh runs under `set -euo pipefail`;

# Prints `clean`, `dirty<TAB>reason`, or `unknown<TAB>reason` — a `dirty`
# verdict from either sub-check always wins, so an `unknown` read never turns
# a genuinely dirty verdict into anything softer.
#
# The two ways to reach `unknown` are not the same thing, and a caller must
# not treat them alike: exit 2 means the required-check list itself could not
# be read, so this still refuses the handoff exactly like `dirty` (an unread
# check list is never certified "nothing wrong" — see lib/review-gate.sh's
# header and TD-PPagop-26081305); exit 0 means only the security-alert (or,
# at the caller, closing-keyword) read failed, which does not itself block —
# the handoff proceeds and the caller is expected to log a warning instead.
#
# Exit 2 carries that fact even when the printed word is `dirty`: a real
# alert still outranks an unreadable required-check list for the word and the
# reason (the pull request has a nameable problem, and a milder node-level
# `unknown` must not hide it), but the word alone would then falsely certify
# the required-checks read as having succeeded — exactly the false reset
# `review_gate_unknown_streak_verdict`'s streak cannot afford
# (TD-PPagop-26081404) — so the read's own health travels in the exit status
# independently of which sub-check won the word: 0 or 1, the required-check
# list was read; 2, it was not. A caller that discards this exit status with

# The following two functions moved from agent-cycle.sh (#771): a Reviewer
# handback that did not end in a human-visible pull request, and the
# consecutive-unreadable-checks streak both the Reviewer's own "ready"
# handoff and the Enabler's recovery path escalate through.
# A Reviewer verdict that did not end in a pull request the human can see
# (requirement 32a): `blocked`, an unparseable status, or a `ready` the
# handoff could not be made true.
#
# It is recorded exactly as any other failed attempt — an `attempt-failed`
# against repo+item, which is what requirement 34 reads as blocked and
# requirement 35a reads as Enabler-eligible. That single choice is what keeps
# the promise the pipeline makes to its human: a pull request that is not ready
# for review is the pipeline's problem until an Enabler says otherwise, and the
# Enabler says otherwise by opening an escalation issue, not by leaving a draft
# where somebody might notice it.
#
# Deliberately silent on the PR itself. The Reviewer has already left its
# concerns there in its own words (requirement 30), which is the record the
# Enabler reads; a second comment from the Script would say nothing new. It
# would not distort the abandoned-drafts clock — a comment this system posts
# carries the marker that keeps it out of that measure (requirement 3e) — but
# "nothing new to say" is reason enough not to post it.

# of consecutive unreadable-checks failures the same way, rather than only
# the former. Prints `review_gate_unknown_streak_verdict`'s own verdict JSON
# (empty below `review_gate_unknown_streak_after` consecutive failures) so a
# caller that also needs to know whether the threshold was reached — the
# Reviewer's own site logs a different per-item warning when it was not —
# does not have to recompute it. Reads `review_gate_unknown_streak_after`,
# `node_name` and `log_file` as globals, same as every other Script-
# bookkeeping helper in this file. Logs `review-gate-checks-degraded` (and
# its stderr echo) at most once per streak — `review_gate_degraded_since` is
# the dedup.
