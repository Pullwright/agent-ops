# lib/stage-health.sh — per-stage health verdict from a node's own log.jsonl
# (issue #662).
#
# During the 2026-08-21 incident (01:38-12:09Z) every stage in every node's
# cycles failed for 10.5 hours, and nothing said so: `agent-cycle.sh
# --status` reported "cycle: RUNNING" (the process was alive), no
# `check-node-*.sh` complained (nothing there reads a stage's own outcome),
# and the dashboard stayed green. All three were technically true — the
# needed detection already existed, as `stage-end`'s own `exit_code` — but
# nothing read it. This file is that reading.
#
# It complements requirement 2.7's crash-loop escalation (lib/crash-loop.sh),
# rather than replacing it: that reader is fleet-wide, matches on one
# identical failure detail, and files a GitHub issue — built for one specific
# deterministic class of Co-Ordinator failure. This reader is node-local,
# purely informational (nothing here ever opens an issue, blocks a cycle, or
# escalates anything), and answers a narrower, cheaper question for every
# stage the Script runs, not only the Co-Ordinator: "is this stage's most
# recent run of attempts on this node succeeding?"
#
# `stage_health_verdicts` is a pure reader of one node's own event stream on
# stdin — deliberately never the fleet union `crash_loop_verdict` reads: a
# stage that is healthy on every other node says nothing about whether it is
# healthy on this one, which is exactly the distinction requirement 2.7's own
# fleet-wide, identical-detail matching cannot draw. Torn lines are skipped
# (`fromjson? // empty`), the same tolerance every other log reader in this
# codebase gives a partial write.
#
# The stream is parsed with `jq -R -n 'inputs'`, one line at a time, and
# deliberately not with the slurp-then-split-on-newlines spelling the other
# log readers here use (lib/crash-loop.sh, lib/review-gate.sh,
# lib/escalation-autonomy.sh — TD-PPagop-26082503). That spelling runs an
# oniguruma regex over the whole slurped file, which is quadratic enough in
# practice that a real 2.3 MB `log.jsonl` takes ~80 s to split and ~0.07 s
# to read with `inputs` — a difference that matters here more than it does
# there, because this reader runs inside every cycle's own `cleanup()` and
# `log.jsonl` is never rotated (scripts/rotate-logs.sh), so the cost would
# grow without bound for the life of the node.
#
# For each stage in `stage_names` (below) it returns:
#   - last_success: the `ts` of the most recent `stage-end` with exit_code 0
#     for that stage, or null if it has never once succeeded on this node.
#   - consecutive_failures: how many of this stage's `stage-end` events in a
#     row, most recent first, count as a failed attempt — reset to 0 the
#     instant a success is seen. Every event carries its own cycle id
#     (`log_event`) — `cycle` for `agent-cycle.sh`'s `log.jsonl`, `monitor`
#     for `monitor-cycle.sh`'s own `monitor-log.jsonl`, the two streams this
#     reader is actually called on (never both in the same invocation) — so a
#     `stage-end` counts as failed when *either* its own `exit_code` is
#     non-zero *or* an `attempt-failed` was logged for that same cycle +
#     stage (TD-PPagop-26082504) — a stage can exit 0 while its attempt
#     nonetheless failed (an unparseable final message, say), and that is
#     exactly as much a failure as a non-zero exit. The same running-streak
#     reduction `crash_loop_verdict` already uses, but per-stage, per-node,
#     and without requiring an identical failure detail: any failure counts,
#     because "always wrong in some new way" is exactly as unhealthy as
#     "always wrong the same way".
#   - last_detail: the `detail` of the current streak's own most recent
#     failure — its matching `attempt-failed` for that failing `stage-end`'s
#     own cycle id, or, when a non-zero exit has no matching `attempt-failed`
#     at all, a synthesized `"stage-end exited <exit_code>"` — while
#     `consecutive_failures` > 0, else null. Joining on the cycle id rather
#     than taking the stage's globally-last `attempt-failed` matters here:
#     without it, a failure from a streak a later success already cleared
#     could still be shown as the *current* one's detail.
#   - verdict: one of:
#       `idle`    — this stage has no `stage-end` record at all on this node
#                   (never invoked, e.g. a Reviewer this node has never had
#                   a pull request to review), or its last success is older
#                   than IDLE_AFTER_HOURS and nothing has failed since — a
#                   stage that simply has had no work is not unhealthy.
#       `failing` — consecutive_failures has reached THRESHOLD.
#       `ok`      — anything else, including a stage that has failed once or
#                   twice but not yet reached THRESHOLD: "one failure does
#                   not trigger a verdict — normal transients exist" is the
#                   issue's own acceptance bar.
#
# THRESHOLD (default 3) and IDLE_AFTER_HOURS (default 48) are one pair of
# defaults shared by every stage, rather than the per-stage table the
# issue's own refinement comment floats, because every stage listed here
# shares the same invocation shape once it does run: one whole attempt per
# cycle, success or failure, with nothing that retries several times inside
# a single cycle the way a `gh` call does. Three consecutive whole-cycle
# failures is already the same order of confidence `crash_loop_after`
# requires by default (4, config.schema.json) before requirement 2.7
# escalates a fleet-wide issue — reached here well before that heavier,
# issue-filing mechanism would ever fire, which is the detection gap #662
# exists to close. Both are ordinary function parameters, not config keys:
# nothing here needs the schema/README/spec table machinery a config key
# would commit this feature to before its numbers have seen a real incident,
# and a stage whose actual behaviour ever diverges enough to need its own
# number can be given one by its caller without touching this file.

# The implementation pipeline's own stages — the set `stage_health_verdicts`
# reads when its caller names none. Kept as a constant rather than inlined in
# the jq program because a second pipeline now asks the same question about
# its own stage over its own stream, and the two answers have to end up in one
# file (see `stage_health_write_status`'s STAGE_NAMES parameter).

# nothing and gets the implementation stages exactly as before.

# Compute `stage_health_verdicts` from LOG_FILE — one pipeline's own stream on
# this node, never the fleet union — and merge it into
# STATE_DIR/.stage-health.json as `{computed_at, threshold, idle_after_hours,
# stages}`, on `write_unattended_status`'s own precedent (scripts/doctor.sh,
# #617): `mktemp` in the same directory, then `mv -f`, so a reader never sees
# a partial file. An unwritable or missing STATE_DIR is a silent no-op, the
# same tolerance doctor's own writer gives it — recording this status is
# never worth failing the cycle that computed it. Always returns 0.
#
# Merged, not overwritten, since agent-ops#1284: two pipelines write this one
# file, each over its own stream — `agent-cycle.sh` at the end of every cycle,
# `monitor-cycle.sh` at the end of every monitor run — and a plain write would
# mean each one filing the *other's* stages as `idle` (they are absent from
# the stream it read), which on the dashboard is indistinguishable from a
# pipeline that has genuinely had no work. Only the stages this call actually
# computed are replaced; every other entry is carried forward untouched.
#
# Two writers and a read-modify-write is a lost update waiting to happen, and
# this one is deliberately left unguarded: the losing write costs one
# refresh of one pipeline's own verdict, the next run of either pipeline
# restores it, and `monitor-cycle.sh` already stands down while a cycle holds
# the node (M3.2), so the overlap is confined to the seconds after a cycle's
# own lock releases. A lock here would be a second lock ordering to reason
# about for a file whose whole content is recomputed from scratch every time.
