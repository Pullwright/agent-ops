#
# lib/refinement.sh — under-specification as a class of block: what the
# Co-Ordinator must produce to report one, what the Script records, which items
# the labels are projected onto, how a human's own hand-applied label is read
# back, and how many refinements one Enabler engagement takes on (requirements
# 16a, 34e, 34g, 35d, 36b, 38b).
#
# ## The gap this closes
#
# Requirement 17 tells the Co-Ordinator to skip an item it cannot rank against
# the "adequately refined" bar, and requirement 16 tells it to skip an item
# gated on a decision only a human can make. Both skips were silent. The item
# was re-read and re-skipped every cycle, for as long as it existed, with
# nothing recorded and nobody told — the pipeline paying to rediscover the same
# non-answer cycle after cycle, and the one person who could fix it never
# learning the item was starving. The failure has this system's signature
# shape: nothing looks broken.
#
# A label alone turned out to be half the fix, the first time round:
# agent-ops#203 was exactly this shape and labelled correctly, yet sat
# invisible because nothing else made it findable. Requirement 38b closed that
# second half by *assigning* the issue to `enabler_assignee` alongside the
# label — until agent-ops#639: assignment as bookkeeping meant "on hold" and
# "a human must personally act" were the same signal on GitHub, so the
# projection could never be told apart from a genuine escalation
# (requirement 36a) or a human's own claim, and stale ones went uncorrected —
# 21 of them, by 2026-08-21. `blocked` plus a reason label
# (`blocked:needs-refinement` today, the only kind this projection covers) is
# the second half now: two labels, applied and removed exactly where the
# assignment used to be, that reach the same Assigned-to-me visibility problem
# without occupying the one signal requirement 36a's genuine escalations still
# need for themselves.
#
# ## Why a block rather than a new state
#
# Because everything the escape path needs already exists for blocked items.
# Selection exclusion (requirement 16.1), Enabler eligibility and its threshold
# (35a), the claim that stops two nodes examining one item (35c), the escalation
# protocol and its duplicate guard (36a), the issue-closed recheck — all of it
# keys on `attempt-failed`/`unblocked` and none of it needs to know why the item
# stopped. A parallel state would have to re-earn every one of those properties,
# and would earn them slightly differently. So a refinement block *is* an
# `attempt-failed`, marked `kind: "needs-refinement"` so the stages that care can
# tell, and invisible to the stages that do not.
#
# The built-in delay is a feature, not a cost of the reuse: the threshold gives
# the human, or the Co-Ordinator's own cheap re-check (requirement 18), several
# cycles to settle the item before the expensive stage is bought.
#
# ## Why the label is a projection and never the record
#
# Work items here are heterogeneous — issues, `TECH-DEBT.md` rows, review
# recommendations, findings, plan tasks, per-round PR refs — and a GitHub label
# can only ever reach one of those sources. A pipeline that read the label as
# its record of *every* item's state would therefore see a sixth of its own
# state and would be wrong about the rest in a way that reads as correct. So
# the shared log stays the record for a block the Co-Ordinator reported: the
# label the Script projects onto it is applied when the item happens to be an
# issue, removed when the block clears, and never read back.
#
# ## Reading the label back for the one writer who cannot use the log
# (requirement 34g)
#
# That rule is deliberately narrower than "never read back" sounds, because it
# was written to describe the Script's *own* projection, and it leaves the one
# person the whole mechanism serves with no way to invoke it: a human reading
# an issue has no `needs_refinement` entry to hand the Co-Ordinator, and no
# `state_dir/log.jsonl` to append to from a browser (the same gap requirement
# 34f closes for a void). Applying the label by hand does nothing, and looks
# exactly like it worked.
#
# So a hand-applied label is a second, narrower kind of report, read back only
# for the blocks it creates. `refinement_hand_flag_new` turns a labelled,
# open issue with no block yet into an `attempt-failed` exactly like a
# Co-Ordinator's `needs_refinement` entry would — `refinement_hand_flag_fields`
# builds it, marked `hand_flagged: true` so the block is traceable to a human
# rather than a model. `refinement_hand_flag_cleared` is the reverse: an issue
# whose block carries that marker but has lost the label maps to the existing
# hand-appended `unblocked` path (requirement 18), because a human taking the
# label off while the block is open is asking for exactly that.
#
# The marker is what keeps this from becoming the wider read-back the design
# note above rejects. A block the Script itself projected the label onto (a
# Co-Ordinator's report) carries no `hand_flagged` field, so removing that
# label — by hand, by mistake, or by whatever the repo's own automation does —
# clears nothing here: that block's lifecycle is still the one-way projection
# it always was, cleared only by the Co-Ordinator's re-check or the Enabler.
# Reading the label back for *every* refinement block, not just the ones a
# human created with it, would silently reopen a block a model is still
# working on the moment anything touches its label — the "reconciliation path
# the current design gets to live without" that made this a deferred decision
# rather than an omission (`TECH-DEBT.md` TD26072602).
#
# Eligibility asks nothing new of a hand-flagged block. Requirement 35a
# already treats the `kind` marker as informational for every clause but the
# threshold — a hand-flagged block crosses the same
# `refinement_after_coordinator_cycles` threshold as a Co-Ordinator's own
# refinement block, because both carry `kind: "needs-refinement"` and the rule
# reads only that. Carving out a faster (or slower) path for this one origin
# would be the exact exception 35a's own design note declines to make, and
# there is no fleet evidence that a human's label needs different pacing than
# a model's report.
#
# Requires `lib/void-guard.sh` (for `entry_field_text`) to be sourced first, as
# agent-cycle.sh does. Sourced, never executed: it sets no shell options,
# because agent-cycle.sh runs under `set -euo pipefail`.
#
# Environment:
#   REFINEMENT_GH           override `gh` (tests stub it).
#   REFINEMENT_LABEL_ENSURE name of a function called as `NAME REPO LABEL`
#                           exactly once per (REPO, LABEL) per process, the
#                           first time `refinement_label_add` sees the add
#                           itself fail — the common case being a repository
#                           where the label was never created (agent-ops#687).
#                           Unset by default, a no-op: agent-cycle.sh, which
#                           sources both this file and lib/labels.sh, sets it
#                           to a function that resolves REPO+LABEL against
#                           the catalogue and calls labels_ensure_one. The
#                           per-pair memoisation means a token that may not
#                           create labels costs one ensure attempt per
#                           process, not one per projection.

# Print, one per line as `<repo>\t<number>\t<label>`, every `blocked`/
# `blocked:<reason>` label an open refinement block for ITEM carries
# (requirement 38b, agent-ops#639). Same shape and the same reasoning as
# `refinement_label_targets` — read that comment for why REPO empty matches
# every repo — extended to two possible label fields per block rather than
# one, since a block projects both `blocked_label` and `blocked_reason_label`
# together.
#
# A *legacy* block — one recorded before agent-ops#639, whose event carries
# `needs_refinement_assignee` and neither blocked-label field — yields only
# the reason label, never the generic `blocked`. `blocked:<reason>` is safe
# regardless: no human reaches for that compound name on their own, so
# `scripts/sweep-legacy-refinement-assignees.sh` can only ever have applied
# it, unconditionally, exactly as the fresh path does. `blocked` is not: it
# is a human's own, hand-applied control (`lib/labels.sh`'s own catalogue),
# and the sweep — like the fresh path — projects it through
# `refinement_label_project`'s read-before-write rather than an unconditional
# add. But unlike the fresh path, the sweep has no event of its own to record
# which of `added`/`present` actually happened: it does not rewrite the
# block's original `attempt-failed` event (nothing rewrites history), so a
# legacy block's `blocked_label` field can never be filled the way a fresh
# block's is. Treating every legacy block as carrying the generic `blocked`
# regardless — the way this once read — would let `release_refinement_label`
# remove a `blocked` a human applied for their own reasons on any issue that
# happens to also carry a still-open pre-agent-ops#639 block: the exact
# defect `refinement_label_project` exists to prevent, reappearing on the one
# path that cannot prove its own history. So a legacy block's `blocked` is
# left alone here — over-held rather than guessed at, the same trade-off
# `refinement_label_project` already makes for an unreadable label list — at
# the moment this path releases the block; `refinement_blocked_label_orphaned`
# below still reaches it once the block has cleared, from live GitHub state
# rather than this function's own provenance test. A legacy block whose issue
# the sweep has not reached yet costs one `gh` call that finds nothing to

# a label a human reaches for on their own (see `refinement_blocked_reason_label`'s

# name is proof enough on its own that it is stuck, no history required.
#
# OPEN_BLOCKED_JSON is requirement 34's blocked extract (`blocked_items`,
# unfiltered by void — the same extract `refinement_blocked_label_stale` reads,
# for the same reason: a void item's label is a separate concern requirement
# 34i's own reconciliation covers, not this one's). LIVE_JSON is REPO's own
# open issues currently carrying the reason label, read live by the caller —
# `[{"number": …, "labels": […]}]` — one `gh` call per repo per cycle, cheaper
# than reading every open issue's labels to find the handful that carry this
# one.
#
# The generic `blocked` does *not* ride along on the reason label's own
# no-human-reaches-for-it proof alone (the PR #823 review on agent-ops#816
# found this: `blocked` is a human's own, hand-applied control, and a modern
# block's `attempt-failed` event already distinguishes "this pipeline added
# it" from "found it already there" — the same distinction
# `refinement_blocked_label_targets` reads at block-clear time). So LOG_FILE
# — the raw union log, read the same way `refinement_blocked_label_stale`
# reads it — is consulted first: for each candidate issue, the most recent
# `attempt-failed` event of this KIND for REPO+item, open or long since
# cleared, decides whether the ride-along is safe:
#   - **no such event at all**, or one recorded before agent-ops#639 (it
#     carries `needs_refinement_assignee` and neither blocked-label field) —
#     the genuinely history-less cohort this function exists for. `blocked`
#     rides along on the live-state proof alone, exactly as before.
#   - **a modern event whose `blocked_label` field is set** — this pipeline
#     recorded adding `blocked` itself. Safe to release, now doubly proven.
#   - **a modern event whose `blocked_label` field is empty** — this pipeline
#     recorded *finding it already present*, or never got as far as recording
#     an application at all (`refinement_label_project`'s `unrecorded`
#     verdict, or an outright failure to apply). None proves it ours, so
#     `blocked` is left alone here too:
#     only the reason label is offered for that issue, the same over-hold
#     `refinement_blocked_label_targets` already applies for a block still
#     open, extended to one already cleared.
# LOG_FILE is optional (omitted or empty reads as "no history available",
# i.e. every candidate falls into the first bullet) so existing callers that
# pass only three arguments keep their prior behaviour.
#
# An issue LIVE_JSON does not name — because it never carried the reason
# label, live or in the fetch — never reaches this function at all, so a
# standalone hand-applied `blocked` is never touched by it.

# Two shapes, because refinement has to land where a *future* Co-Ordinator will
# read it and that place differs by item type. For an item with a thread the
# Enabler or Refiner posts one authoritative comment, which the Co-Ordinator
# already pastes into the work order along with the rest of the thread — so the
# event records the comment URL as a pointer. For an item with no thread to
# write into (a review recommendation, a plan task) the spec itself travels in
# the log and requirement 3h injects it into the Co-Ordinator's runtime input.
# Which of the two an item can hold is settled by whether it has an issue
# number, never by the band it was gathered from (agent-ops#1128): tech-debt
# had no thread until agent-ops#875 gave it one, and reading the band instead
# of the item is what kept 98 of 106 candidates on the expensive shape.
#
# The two are exclusive, and a URL wins (agent-ops#1128). A pointer and a
# payload recording the same refinement is not redundancy that costs nothing:
# the payload is several kilobytes in the one band requirement 4i's ladder
# cannot shed, and the pointer already resolves to the same text — requirement
# 17f's own traceability check reads the comment for exactly this reason. An
# entry that offers both is therefore recorded as the pointer alone.

# comment — REFINEMENT_COMMENT_URL_RE false for it, a bare issue URL being the
# shape both #818 and #874 recorded — is treated exactly as absent, on the
# same terms as an empty `refined_spec`: it earns no `comment_url` field, so
# every caller's own corroboration check sees nothing to record rather than a
# URL that can never be traced back to a real comment.  TD-PPagop-26082603's
# `comments_posted[0]`-is-an-array case reaches the same outcome by the same
# route: a non-string value is rejected outright, before the pattern test ever
# runs, rather than stringified into something that could coincidentally pass
# it.
#
# Nothing at all means the item was unblocked/refined without actually being
# refined, which the caller records as a warning: the block clears (or is

# Print, as a JSON array, every item from this cycle's pre-fetched source
# arrays — `findings`, `review_feedback`, `abandoned_drafts`, `merge_conflicts`,
# `dequeued`, `landing_refusals`, `register_hygiene`, `issues`, `tech_debt`,
# `project_review`, `implementation_plan` — that the Refiner may spend an
# engagement on: its
# source's policy is not `exempt` (requirement 39a), it carries no refinement
# yet (REFINEMENTS_JSON, requirement 3h), and it is not already blocked,
# void, or held by an ordinary implementation claim — except an `issues`
# entry gather-issues.sh marked `priority_set: false`, which is a candidate
# even when already refined, solely for its missing `Priority` band
# (requirement 39g), and except an item DECISIONS_JSON (requirement 36d)
# still carries a pending decision for — a `decide-tactical` verdict never
# writes a specification, so a refined item it decided owes the Refiner a
# fresh one exactly as a never-refined item would (agent-ops#1049). The
# `issues` exception carries `triage_only: true` so the Refiner knows not to
# write a second specification for it; the decision exception does not — it
# needs the full spec, not one field — and carries `decision` instead (below).
#
# Each entry is `{repo, source, item, entry}` — `entry` is the gatherer's own
# object verbatim (an issue's full thread, a finding's title and severity, a
# tech-debt item's whole file), because the Refiner needs it to write a
# specification without a second fetch, the same reason the Co-Ordinator is
# handed it pre-fetched rather than told to query it. A `decision` field
# (agent-ops#936, requirement 36d) rides alongside `entry`, never inside it,
# when `decisions` names one for this repo+item: a tactical decision a
# decide-tactical pass already took in place of escalating, which the Refiner
# turns into the actual specification the way it would a human's own answer
# on a closed escalation.
#
# The first nine arrays are the same per-repo arrays requirement 3 assembles
# for the Co-Ordinator's own `ordered_repos_json`. `project_review` and
# `implementation_plan` are not: the Co-Ordinator still reads `reviews/…` and
# the plan document live (prompts/coordinator.md), so those two arrays exist
# only in the Refiner-only copy of the repos array `agent-cycle.sh` builds
# for this call (`refiner_repos_json`), narrower than the tech-debt-style
# pre-fetch and never folded into the Co-Ordinator's own input
# (TD-PPagop-26081307).

# repository contributing a `triage_only: true` candidate — a cycle with none
# at all makes no query here — and drops that repository's `triage_only`
# candidates when the field cannot be resolved *or* resolves carrying none of
# the four band names at all (agent-ops#542 — a repository that renamed every
# option, e.g. to `P0`…`P3`; the narrower agent-ops#534 case, missing only
# *some* of the four, is unaffected here and still reaches the Refiner, since
# `issue_priority_apply`'s own fallback bands it), so the Refiner is never
