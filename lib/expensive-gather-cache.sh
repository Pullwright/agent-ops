# lib/expensive-gather-cache.sh — per-node cache that lets
# `gather_ordered_repos` (lib/candidate-gather.sh) run each cycle's expensive
# per-repository reads — issue threads with comments,
# PR review reads, merge-conflict/dequeued walks — for one
# configured repository only, instead of every one of them (requirement 48,
# agent-ops#1086).
#
# Before this, every cycle re-read every configured repository's whole
# candidate set regardless of which one it went on to select, so the fleet's
# GitHub read volume scaled with (repositories × nodes × cycles) for
# information that is identical across a node's own cycles until something
# in that repository actually changes. `expensive_gather_pick_repo` below
# turns that into one full read per node per cycle: whichever configured
# repository this node has gone longest without expensively reading gets
# read fresh this cycle, and every other one reuses the snapshot this same
# node captured the last time its own turn came around.
#
# ## Per-node, not fleet-wide
#
# The cache lives under this node's own `state_dir`, exactly like
# `lib/labels.sh`'s ensure-stamp — it is not synced fleet-wide the way the
# union log is: `scripts/state-sync.sh`'s `EXCLUDES` excludes
# `state_dir/expensive-gather/` from general replication, on the same
# checkout-fresh-mtime reasoning as `labels-ensured/` — a cache restored from
# the fleet state branch would make every repository look freshly read.
# A fleet-shared cache (the node that gathers first in an
# interval writing a snapshot every node reuses) is a real further
# reduction — issue #1086's own "Option 2" — but it is a state-store
# contract, deliberately left for whenever D21/Phase 2 settles what that
# store's interface is, rather than retrofitted ahead of it. Each node
# therefore still visits every configured repository's cache once per
# `repositories` cycles, on its own schedule, independent of its peers'.
#
# ## Oldest-cache-wins, not commit-staleness
#
# Picking is keyed on *when this node last expensively read a repository*,
# not on `lib/repo-order.sh`'s own effective-age ordering (last commit to the
# default branch, weighted by `nice`). The two answer different questions:
# repo-order says which repository is most overdue to be *worked*, and is a
# pure function of GitHub state the whole fleet computes identically — every
# node would pick the same repository to expensively read every cycle, and
# every other configured repository would starve of a fresh read for as long
# as nothing landed on its default branch, which can be indefinitely for a
# repository this pipeline has never yet gathered enough to select work in.
# Keying on this node's own last-read time instead guarantees every
# configured repository eventually gets its turn on this node, regardless of
# commit activity: reading it resets its own clock, so cache age rotates
# through every configured repository the same way `labels_ensure_stamped`'s
# per-repo, per-role stamps do.
#
# ## What is cached, and what is re-applied every cycle regardless
#
# The cache holds each pre-fetched band's *raw* gather — before claim
# exclusion, before `sources` gating, before `emit_first_seen` — so the
# caller can re-apply this cycle's own fresh claims and fresh `sources`
# config to a cached read exactly as it does to a fresh one; only the
# underlying GitHub read itself is skipped for a repository not picked this
# cycle. A claim landed by a peer since a repository's last expensive read
# therefore still excludes a cached candidate this cycle, and a `sources`
# edit still gates a cached band, even though neither required a fresh `gh`
# call to take effect.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh, ahead of lib/candidate-gather.sh, which is the
# only caller.

# expensive_gather_pick_repo STATE_DIR REPOS_JSON NODE_NAME

# zero-byte or unparseable (`_expensive_gather_cache_valid`), sorts as epoch
# 0, so it is always picked ahead of one this node holds a genuinely usable
# cache for. Ties (every configured repository scoring the same — most often
# the fleet's first-ever cycle, when every configured repository is
# uncached) no longer break on slug ascending: every node that ties the same
# way would then pick the same repository every interval, which is exactly
# the starvation requirement 48 exists to prevent (agent-ops#1106). Instead,
# ties break on NODE_NAME's own rotation: sort REPOS_JSON's slugs ascending,
# then break a tie in favour of the slug at index `hash(NODE_NAME) mod M`
# (`_expensive_gather_node_offset`) in that ascending list — a fixed,
# per-node offset into the same underlying order, so two nodes whose names
# hash to different offsets pick different repositories on the same cycle,
# and the same node ties the same way every time it recurs. This spreads a
# fleet without any coordination; it does not guarantee the fleet covers.
# Two node names can hash to the same offset — N names drawn independently
# into M buckets ordinarily leave one unoccupied — and the repository at an
# unoccupied offset is read fresh by no node at all that interval, while the
# nodes sharing an offset stay aligned with each other. Whatever stagger the
# hash does give holds only from a common start — nodes whose caches were
# populated in the same interval; a node that stands down before the gather
# (requirement 2's ladder) falls one rotation step behind its peers and the
# phases drift apart from there.
#
# REPOS_JSON with no entries prints nothing; the caller must treat that as
# "nothing to pick" rather than call this with an empty set.
#
# `sed -n '1p'` rather than `head -n1`, on the rule agent-ops#806 wrote and
# `scripts/state-sync.sh`'s `kept_cycles` already follows: `head` closes the
# pipe the instant it has its line, `sort` — which cannot emit anything
# before it has read every one — may still be writing, and that SIGPIPE
# becomes 141 for the whole pipeline under `pipefail`. The call shape is what
# makes it fatal rather than inert, and this one is the fatal one: the caller
# in `lib/candidate-gather.sh` takes this in `$(…)` under `set -e`, so a
# promoted 141 would abort the whole gather — and with it the cycle — rather
# than merely yield an empty pick. `sed` without `q` reads its input to the
# end, so nothing upstream is ever signalled.
