# lib/stage-run.sh leaves in `<stage>.out` — rather than each growing its own
# copy of the field list.

# lib/model-id.sh's map, read by `provider` below — declared defensively
# here too (same guard as lib/stage-run.sh's own copy) since this file is
# sourced standalone by test/metering.test.sh, never lib/model-id.sh.

# metering_fields MODEL OUT_FILE [GAPS_JSON]
# Prints the documented per-stage metering object: model, provider, cost_usd,
# duration_ms, num_turns, is_error, tokens{input,output,cache_creation,
# cache_read}, and gaps. MODEL is the id passed to the invocation (not
# re-derived from the envelope, which may be silent or ambiguous about it);
# OUT_FILE is the stage's own `.out` transcript.
#
# `provider` (issue #2133) is read from `lib/model-id.sh`'s MODEL_PROVIDER —
# the same map `lib/stage-run.sh`'s `run_model_stage` reads to choose a
# substrate — rather than taken as a parameter, so every existing caller's
# `metering_fields "$model" "$out_file" "$gaps"` keeps working unchanged: the
# provider for MODEL was already recorded the moment that model string was
# resolved via `resolve_model_id_into` — the assigning form, and only that
# one, since the printing `resolve_model_id` runs in a command substitution
# whose subshell takes the recording with it. Falls back to `anthropic`
# exactly as `run_model_stage`'s own lookup does, for a MODEL the map holds
# nothing for (every test that never called
# `providers_load`/`resolve_model_id_into` first, and every model this image
# has ever run before this issue). An empty MODEL is handled separately: bash
# makes an empty subscript on an associative array a hard "bad array
# subscript" error rather than an empty read, so `:-anthropic` never gets a
# chance to apply.
#
# GAPS_JSON is the one field that does not come from the envelope, because it
# cannot: it is what the Script observed of the run's own event stream while
# the run was happening (`lib/stage-run.sh`'s `stage_gaps_json`), and nothing
# the run writes at the end records it. It is passed in rather than read here
# so this function stays a pure derivation from a file, testable against a
# canned envelope; omitted or unparseable, it degrades to `null` like every
# other field, so a caller that has no gaps to report — or an envelope
# examined long after the fact — still yields a conforming record.
#
# tokens sums the envelope's `modelUsage` map across every model entry rather
# than reading its top-level `usage` object: `usage` excludes subagent
# activity while `modelUsage` — like `total_cost_usd` — includes it, and the
# two would otherwise disagree about what "this stage" spent. `tokens` is
# null when `modelUsage` is absent or empty, exactly as `cost_usd` and the
# rest are null when the envelope itself is missing or unparseable — a stage
# that never ran, or crashed before writing one, degrades this whole object
# to nulls rather than aborting the log_event call it feeds. `model` alone is
# always present: it is the argument, not something read out of the envelope.
#
# That degradation has to hold for *any* envelope, not just the shapes
# anticipated below, because of what the callers do with the result: it is
# interpolated into `jq --argjson m` at the `stage-end` site, so a run that
# printed nothing would fail that jq too and cost the whole event its `stage`
# and `exit_code` — the fields requirements 33/34 key on — not merely its
# metering. Hence both the per-entry `select` in `tokens` and the fallback
# after the call: whatever jq makes of the envelope, this function prints one
# valid object.
