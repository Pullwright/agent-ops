# lib/drain.sh — at-rest detection and reporting for the `--drain` switch
# mode (requirement 2.9). `lib/toggle.sh` owns the switch itself, including
# the `mode` field a `--drain` record carries (requirement 2.3d); this file
# is everything downstream of "a drain is active", read only by
# `agent-cycle.sh` and the management/status/dashboard/heartbeat readers of
# its output — never by `review-cycle.sh`, which has no finishing set of its
# own and stands down under either mode exactly as it always has (requirement
# R2a, docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md).
#
# "At rest" (2.2a's own finishing set, applied unconditionally rather than
# only when back-pressure trips): every repo's four finishing bands —
# `review_feedback`, `merge_conflicts`, `dequeued`, `abandoned_drafts` — are
# empty, *and* no live claim (requirement 17a) names a finishing-source ref.
# `landing_refusals` (requirement 53) is deliberately not a fifth: whether
# this source should share the other four's back-pressure/drain/claim/
# void-guard treatment is a separate policy question issue #979's own refined
# scope did not ask for, tracked as its own deferred item (issue #1481).
# The second half exists because a claim can be taken moments before its PR
# is opened; a cycle's own gather sees no PR yet, but the work is not
# actually finished, and a `drained` event fired on that gap would be a false
# "we are done" for anyone watching the dashboard for it.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh, after lib/toggle.sh (for `_toggle_iso`) and
# lib/claim.sh (for `do_claims`) and lib/fleet.sh (for `fleet_logs`) — none of
# which this file re-sources, since `#771`'s own convention is that
# agent-cycle.sh sources every lib/*.sh once into one process and each file
# documents what it needs rather than fetching it itself.

# A finishing-source claim ref, per requirement 17a: `pr-<n>-review-…`,
# `pr-<n>-conflict-…`, `pr-<n>-dequeued-…`, `pr-<n>-abandoned-…`.

# drain_live_finishing_claims REPOS_JSON
# Every live claim, across every repo named in REPOS_JSON (an `.[].slug`
# array — the same shape ordered_repos_json/all_repos_json already carry),
# whose `item` names a finishing-source ref. One `lib/claim.sh claims` call
# per repo — the same per-repo listing the Script already pays for elsewhere
# in the cycle (requirement 3o) — filtered down to the four finishing kinds.
# `lib/claim.sh` is a standalone script, not sourced (#771's own split keeps
# claim-taking out of the long-lived cycle process), so this shells out to it
# exactly as every other claim-listing call site does; `CLAIM_GH` passes
# through whatever `gh` override the caller's environment already set (the
# test suite's own stub), since a subprocess does not inherit a sourced
# function's `TOGGLE_GH`-style substitution any other way.
