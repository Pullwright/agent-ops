# lib/work-gone.sh — which blocked items are blocked on work that no longer
# exists (requirement 34i).
#
# A block says "something is in the way *for now*", and requirement 34 leaves
# clearing it to somebody who looks: the Co-Ordinator, which re-checks its own
# blocked list, or the Enabler, which re-examines at Opus prices. Both of those
# readers have a blind spot in the same place, and it is the ordinary case:
#
#   the item is not blocked any more because the *work* is gone.
#
# The issue was closed, the pull request merged, the register entry flipped to
# `resolved`. Nothing about that moment produces an event — the merge is a
# click, whether a human's in a browser or the Script's own — so the block
# outlives the work it describes.
# The Co-Ordinator never revisits it, because a finished item is offered by no
# source and so never reaches the Co-Ordinator's candidates at all; the Enabler
# does, but only after `enabler_recheck_hours`, and it pays a full engagement to
# discover what one `gh` read already sitting on disk would have said. The item
# that prompted this had been merged, register-flipped and done for a day, with
# an escalation issue closed behind it, and was still listed as blocked, waiting
# on a re-examination that was two days away.
#
# So this is the cheap half of that judgement, made deterministically, from
# state the cycle already holds. It clears nothing that is *still* work and asks
# no model anything: it answers one question per item class, and only where the
# answer is a fact.
#
#   an issue              the issue is not in the repo's open-issue digest
#   a pull request        the pull request is not in the repo's open-PR digest
#                         (`pr-<n>-abandoned-…`, `-conflict-…`, `-review-…`)
#   a register item       the item's own file on the default branch says
#                         `status: resolved` or `status: not-debt`
#   a project-review ref  a *merged* pull request on the default branch names
#                         the recommendation's own `review-<date>-R-NN` ref —
#                         the same test requirement 16 already applies when
#                         deciding whether to offer the recommendation as a
#                         candidate at all, read here instead of asked of a
#                         model
#   a plan task id         the task's own checkbox, in the repo's
#                         `implementation_plan_path` document on the default
#                         branch, is checked (`- [x]`)
#
# Everything else — a security or code-quality finding, or a
# human-visibility item — is left blocked for the Enabler, and deliberately:
# `gather-findings.sh` degrades to `[]` on an API error *by design*, because
# its output is given to the Co-Ordinator and a Co-Ordinator that sees no
# findings simply declines. Read as a clearing signal, that same `[]` says
# "every alert is fixed", and one 403 would clear every alert block on the
# fleet. The digest this file reads instead carries `ok` precisely so that an
# unsampled repo can be told from an empty one (requirement 3b), and an
# `ok: false` repo clears nothing here. A human-visibility item has no
# completion signal at all to read — GitHub's own live pull-request state
# *is* the item, and its own re-derivation is what
# `gather-human-visibility-hygiene.sh` itself repairs.
#
# The event written is `unblocked`, never `item-void`. Requirement 34d makes a
# void something that must be *corroborated* and 34c makes it terminal, and
# neither is what this is: this is the cheap, reversible half of the judgement,
# and requirement 34 names over-clearing the safe direction — an item wrongly
# unblocked becomes a candidate again, is offered by no source, and nothing
# happens.
#
# Sourced, never executed: it sets no shell options, because agent-cycle.sh runs
# under `set -euo pipefail`.

# The id shapes this rule can decide, kept in one place because two readers need
# them: the clearance rule below, and the Script, which asks each side-channel
# only about the ids that could possibly be its shape (`work_gone_register_ids`,
# `work_gone_review_refs`, `work_gone_plan_ids`).
#
# `TD26072401` is the legacy flat id and `TD-PPpoet-26072401` the scoped one
# (`docs/TECH-DEBT-REGISTER.md` in Poetic-Poems/poetic); both are live, because
# a block predating a register's migration still names the item by the id it had
# when it was recorded.

# BLOCKED_JSON is the open blocked set (`open_blocked_items`, requirement 34h):

#
# SOURCE_STATES_JSON is the cycle's own array of source-state digests
# (requirement 3b), one per repo it walked. A repo missing from it, or carrying
# `ok: false`, decides nothing: unknown is not gone. That is the same direction
# requirement 35a's escalation test fails in, for the same reason — the cost of
# waiting is one more cycle, and the cost of being wrong is a block cleared out
# from under work that is still real.
#
# REGISTER_STATUS_JSON maps repo → item id → the `status` field of that item's
# file on the default branch (`scripts/gather-register-status.sh`). Absent, empty
# or unreadable means the register was not read, which decides nothing either.
#
# REVIEW_STATUS_JSON maps repo → recommendation ref → "merged" when a merged
# pull request on the default branch names that ref
# (`scripts/gather-review-status.sh`); anything else absent or unreadable
# decides nothing.
#
# PLAN_STATUS_JSON maps repo → task id → "done" or "open", read off that task's
# own checkbox in the repo's implementation-plan document
# (`scripts/gather-plan-status.sh`); anything else absent or unreadable decides
# nothing.
#
# Always succeeds, printing [] for input it cannot read: the caller runs under
# `set -e` mid-cycle, and a malformed digest must cost a clearance, never a
