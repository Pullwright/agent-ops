# lib/memory.sh — free host memory, and this container's own memory cgroup,
# read and judged one way everywhere: `scripts/doctor.sh`'s advisory warnings
# and `agent-cycle.sh`'s pre-cycle stand-down gate (requirement 2.0f) share
# this rather than each doing its own `/proc/meminfo` arithmetic, so the two
# can no longer silently disagree about what "low" means. It is the memory
# counterpart of `lib/disk-space.sh`, deliberately the same shape.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# Requirement 2.0c stands a cycle down when `workspace_root` is short of
# disk. Nothing did the same for memory, and on the ockham WSL2 host that is
# the half that keeps biting: the VM is capped at 6 GiB, two nodes' cycles
# overlap for most of every hour, and a cycle that starts into a host with no
# headroom pushes the VM into a Windows-backed swap file, whereupon the whole
# machine stalls. A stand-down costs one cycle; a freeze costs the host, and
# takes the state mirrors' git objects with it (#604).
#
# ## What can be read from inside a container, and what cannot
#
# Two facts this file rests on, both verified on the ockham node 2026-09-04:
#
#   1. `/proc/meminfo` is **not** namespaced. A container reads its host's
#      (here, the WSL2 VM's) real MemTotal and MemAvailable, which is exactly
#      what a gate protecting the host needs — the cgroup's own accounting
#      would describe only this container and miss the peer node, the editor
#      and everything else sharing the machine.
#
#   2. A container can read, but not write, its own cgroup v2 files. So this
#      file can *report* that `memory.high` is unset while `memory.current`
#      sits near `memory.max` — the state in which nothing reclaims until the
#      hard limit — but it cannot fix it. Docker exposes no `memory.high`
#      setting at all, and its `--memory-swap` is silently inert wherever
#      `docker info` reports "No swap limit support" (which is a false
#      negative on this kernel: the cgroup accepts the write, Docker's own
#      cgroup-v1 probe simply fails to detect it). The remedy is therefore an
#      operator recipe, documented in `deploy/docker/compose.yaml`, and what
#      this file contributes is the detection that tells an operator to run
#      it.
#
# ## What this file deliberately does not do
#
# Release page cache. `posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)` does work
# unprivileged from inside the container and drops clean, unmapped cache
# immediately (measured: 307 MiB in one call), but it earns almost nothing
# here: a cycle already deletes its clone, and deleting a file frees its
# cache anyway, so the only trees that survive a cycle are the state
# directory and the peer mirrors — which a `memory.high` that is actually set
# keeps trimmed continuously. Measured on a live node with `memory.high` in
# force, fadvising every file under `workspace_root`, `state_dir`, the Claude
# configuration and `/app` released **zero** bytes: what remained was mapped
# executables and libraries, which `DONTNEED` cannot evict. A cycle-end
# release pass would therefore be code that runs every cycle to do nothing.

# memory_available_kb
# MemAvailable from /proc/meminfo, in KiB (that file's own unit), or empty if
# it cannot be read. Never prints `0` for "unreadable": a caller must be able
# to tell "definitely short" from "no idea", the same distinction
# `disk_space_free_kb` and `github_limit_verdict`'s `unknown` already draw.
#
# MemAvailable, not MemFree: the kernel's own estimate of what a new
# allocation can have without swapping, which counts reclaimable page cache
# as available. MemFree would read a host whose cache is doing its job as
# critically short and stand down every cycle on a healthy machine.

# kernel without these files), because a doctor pass that cannot read a knob
# must say so rather than assert a verdict it did not measure.

# the tests can point it at a fixture rather than the live one.

# MEMORY_CGROUP_PARENT_HIGH is a read-only window onto the *parent* cgroup's
# `memory.high` — the one number a container cannot otherwise learn about
# itself.
#
# Under `cgroup_parent` (deploy/docker/compose.yaml) the ceiling that governs
# this container is set on an ancestor, because an ancestor is the only place
# it can be set that a container recreation does not wipe. The kernel does not
# expose an effective, hierarchy-wide `memory.high` anywhere, and a cgroup
# namespace makes the container's own cgroup the root of what it can see, so
# ancestors are invisible from in here: measured on the poetic node
# 2026-09-08, a container held to 64 MiB by its parent read its own
# `memory.high` as `max` and its own `memory.events` `high` as `0` while the
# parent counted 250 reclaim events. The only trace in the child was
# `pgscan`/`pgsteal`, which rise under ordinary host pressure too and so
# cannot distinguish a configured ceiling from a busy machine.
#
# Hence one file, bind-mounted read-only, rather than an inference. It reads
# empty when the variable is unset, because compose mounts `/dev/null` there
# — the same no-op-mount idiom the Approver key uses in that file — so the
# default is provably "no parent ceiling" rather than a guess. The mount
# cannot go stale beneath us: a cgroup cannot be removed while a process lives
# in it, so this container's own existence pins the parent it points at.

# memory_cgroup_verdict
# Whether anything will reclaim this container's memory before it reaches its
# hard ceiling:
#
#   unbounded  `memory.max` is a real ceiling but `memory.high` is `max` here
#              and on the parent, so nothing throttles or reclaims until the
#              hard limit. The cgroup ratchets: page cache accumulates to the
#              ceiling and is given back only under pressure, which on a
#              memory-capped VM means the whole host is already in trouble.
#   bounded    `memory.high` is set on this cgroup — the kernel reclaims
#              proactively. This is what the one-shot operator recipe leaves
#              behind, and it lasts until the container is next recreated.
#   parented   this cgroup's own `memory.high` is `max`, but an ancestor
#              carries a real `memory.high` **and** the parent's own
#              `memory.max` is a real hard ceiling **strictly above** this
#              cgroup's own **and** the parent's `memory.high` sits no more
#              than ~25% below this cgroup's own `memory.max` — so the
#              parent's ceiling actually adds headroom the kernel can reclaim
#              into, and the throttle band between the parent's `memory.high`
#              and this cgroup's own `memory.max` is narrow enough for the
#              workload to cross it — and unlike `bounded` it survives a
#              roll, because the ceiling does not live on the container.
#              Distinguished from `bounded` rather than folded into it because
#              the two differ in exactly the property this check exists to
#              report: whether the node will still be bounded tomorrow.
#   livelocked the parent carries a real `memory.high` below this cgroup's own
#              `memory.max`, and either the parent's own `memory.max` adds no
#              usable headroom, or it does but the band it opens is too wide
#              for the workload to cross:
#                - the parent's own `memory.max` is `max` (no hard ceiling
#                  anywhere), or a real number that is no higher than this
#                  cgroup's own `memory.max` (a hard ceiling exists, but
#                  coincides with or sits below the child's own, so it adds no
#                  kill point beyond one this cgroup already has on its own);
#                - or the parent's own `memory.max` **is** a real ceiling
#                  strictly above this cgroup's own, but the parent's
#                  `memory.high` sits more than ~25% below this cgroup's own
#                  `memory.max` — the kernel's reclaim under `memory.high`
#                  throttles severely enough across that wide a band that the
#                  workload never makes enough progress to reach either kill
#                  point, so a headroom-adding ceiling still livelocks in
#                  practice (agent-ops#1643).
#              Either way `memory.high` throttles the whole hierarchy without
#              ever disengaging in practice. agent-ops#1305: 2,788,595
#              throttle events and a node wedged in `D` state for 75 minutes,
#              with `memory.high` `max` on the parent. agent-ops#1620: the
#              same band reached with a *real* parent `memory.max` (1536 MiB)
#              coincident with the child's own. agent-ops#1643 extrapolated
#              from both incidents: the band is reachable whatever the
#              parent's `memory.max` is, so a parent `memory.max` (say 3072
#              MiB) strictly above the child's own (1536 MiB) is not itself
#              proof against livelock — it still livelocks if the parent's
#              `memory.high` (say 768 MiB) sits far enough below the child's
#              own `memory.max` — the live discriminator is the throttle
#              band's *width*, not merely whether the parent's `memory.max`
#              exists above it. A narrow band (parent `memory.high` 1400 MiB,
#              parent `memory.max` 2048 MiB, this cgroup's own `memory.max`
#              1536 MiB — under a 10% gap) keeps reading `parented`, which is
#              what the 25% threshold is tuned to preserve.
#   unconfirmed the parent carries a real `memory.high` below this cgroup's
#              own `memory.max`, but the parent's own `memory.max` cannot be
#              read — an un-migrated compose.yaml, or a node that has not
#              re-run `cgroup-parent-setup.sh` since it started mounting that
#              window — so whether the livelock band above is actually closed
#              is unmeasured, not confirmed. Never reported as `parented`: a
