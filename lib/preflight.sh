# lib/preflight.sh — the done-check the Script runs on the item a cycle just
# claimed, before it pays for an Implementer engagement (issue #245).
#
# `lib/work-gone.sh` already answers "is this item's work gone?" for the
# blocked set, from digests the cycle gathers anyway — an issue closed, a pull
# request closed or merged, a register row resolved or not-debt. A freshly
# claimed candidate is not blocked, but the question is identical, and
# TD-PPpfid-26072801 (re-selected and re-implemented 21 hours after it
# merged) shows it is exactly as live for a fresh claim as for a stalled one:
# the register said `resolved` the whole time, and nothing asked it until the
# Implementer stage did — a full engagement to learn what one `gh` read
# already sitting in the cycle's own gathered state would have said.
#
# `preflight_done_reason` is a one-item call into that same machinery, not a
# second implementation of it: it wraps `work_gone_clearances` around a
# synthetic one-entry blocked list. Pure — it reads nothing itself — so it
# needs no corroboration guard (requirement 34d exists to catch a model's
# fabricated citation; there is no model in this path to fabricate one) and
# is fit to feed `log_item_void` directly: every fact it reports (an issue
# closed, a pull request closed or merged, a register row resolved), once
# true, stays true, which is what makes a terminal void safe on it.
#
# `preflight_defer_reason` is the signal that deliberately does NOT feed a
# void (#279): an open pull request already carrying this claim's own branch,
# read from the cycle's own `source_states_json` (the "stale claim, previous
# cycle's branch/PR already exists" shape a lost-then-recovered claim race
# can produce). It is the one fact in this file that can become false again —
# that pull request may close unmerged tomorrow — and its usual cause is
# narrower still: the digest is sampled before the Co-Ordinator engagement,
# so by claim time the pull request it shows is often already gone, and a
# branch claim is create-only (`lib/claim.sh`), so winning it proves the ref
# did not exist at claim time at all. A void is terminal (requirement 34h:
# never re-examined; only a human clears one), so voiding on a reversible,
# probably-stale fact would retire live items silently. The caller instead
# releases the claim and ends the cycle — the item is free again the next
# cycle, judged against a fresh digest. The check stays, unreachable as it
# nearly is, because it is cheap, pure, and the state it names is one this
# cycle must not work either way.
#
# `preflight_branch_merged_reason` is the other named done-signal — "the
# work-order branch is already merged" — and it is deliberately kept apart
# from the pure functions above: it is impure, one live `gh api compare` call
# against the *target* repository (no local clone needed, so it does not
# conflict with running pre-flight before the workspace clone). It is also
# deliberately never called for an ordinary issues/tech-debt claim: the
# Script creates that branch fresh, at the default branch's own head, as the
# claim itself (see agent-cycle.sh's "Branch" step), so comparing it against
# that same head the moment the claim is won would always read "identical"
# and void every ordinary claim on its first tick. The five sources whose
# branch and PR predate the claim — review-feedback, merge-conflicts,
# dequeued, landing-refusals, abandoned-drafts, the ones whose branch this
# cycle did not just create — are the only ones an ancestry check can mean
# anything for, and
# `preflight_existing_branch_source` is that gate.
#
# `preflight_review_feedback_reason` is a third named done-signal, and the
# reason `work_gone_clearances`'s own PR-shaped clearance is not enough for a
# `pr-<n>-review-<id>` item (issue #1360): that clearance only asks whether
# the pull request itself has left the open-PR digest, never whether the
# *specific* review round this ref names is still the reviewer's standing
# position. A `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review answered and then superseded by an
# `APPROVED` from the same reviewer — including a bot reviewer, whose own
# approval is exactly the case requirement 34a's own `gather-review-
# feedback.sh` comment describes as unreachable any other way — leaves the
# pull request itself open throughout, so `work_gone_clearances` never fires,
# and a claim of the same stale ref (most often replayed from a non-selected
# node's `expensive-gather` cache, requirement 48, which is not re-verified
# before a claim proceeds) would otherwise burn a full Implementer engagement
# on a round that is already closed. Like `preflight_branch_merged_reason`,
# it is impure — one live `gh api` read of the pull request's own reviews —
# and gated to the same `review-feedback` source for the same reason: it
# costs one call, paid once, for the single freshly claimed item, immediately
# before the engagement it would otherwise waste.
#
# Sourced, never executed: this file sets no shell options, because
# agent-cycle.sh runs under `set -euo pipefail`. `preflight_done_reason`
# depends on `work_gone_clearances` (lib/work-gone.sh), sourced first;
# `preflight_review_feedback_reason` likewise depends on `handoff_latest_
# positions` (lib/handoff.sh), also sourced first.
