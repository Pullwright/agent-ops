# lib/reconciliation-gate.sh — script-side confirmation that every standing
# human comment on a pull request has actually been answered before that pull
# request is taken out of draft (requirement 31c, agent-ops#533).
#
# PR #512: a human requested three changes in a plain PR comment
# (2026-08-16T22:16Z) and flipped the pull request back to draft, saying
# explicitly that the comment-plus-draft-flip *is* the change-request signal
# — a formal `REQUEST_CHANGES` review is unavailable here, because every
# pipeline write and every human comment on this project's own pull requests
# land under the same GitHub account (see lib/pipeline-marker.sh's header),
# and GitHub refuses a review request or a review decision from a pull
# request's own author regardless of who is typing. The next Reviewer engagement
# fixed one of the three points, declared the pull request ready, and never
# mentioned the other two — one of which it directly contradicted, asserting a
# tech-debt record was "correctly left" exactly as the human had just said it
# should not be. `handoff_complete_review`'s existing gates had nothing to say
# about this: CI was green, the closing keyword was intact, and no code-scanning
# alert had ever been introduced. The defect was never in the diff; it was in
# what the Reviewer's own completion comment failed to address.
#
# This file is the fix, following the same shape `lib/closing-keyword-gate.sh`
# already established for a fact GitHub itself can confirm about a pull
# request's own comment history rather than trusting a model's summary of it:
#
#   - the anchor is the pull request's most recent `ready_for_review` timeline
#     event *at or before NOT_AFTER* that was not itself later undone by a
#     `convert_to_draft` event at or before NOT_AFTER — the moment it last
#     left draft, and stayed left, as of the point the round began — falling
#     back to the pull request's own creation time when no such event exists.
#     See `_reconciliation_gate_anchor` for why the bound is not optional in
#     practice, and why an undone flip must be skipped too: without both, the
#     anchor is invalidated by the very flip this gate exists to check, first
#     within the round that flip happened in (agent-ops#533) and then again,
#     one round later, by that same flip once refused and reverted
#     (agent-ops#539);
#   - a "human comment" is any general PR comment (`/issues/<n>/comments`,
#     where `gh pr comment` files them) posted after that anchor, from a
#     non-Bot account that is not a GitHub App acting on someone's behalf
#     (`performed_via_github_app`), whose body does not carry
#     `lib/pipeline-marker.sh`'s `PIPELINE_COMMENT_MARKER_PREFIX` — the same
#     "no marker, not a Bot" rule that tells a human's write apart from the
#     pipeline's own everywhere else in this codebase, because author alone
#     cannot (see that file's header);
#   - it counts as reconciled once some pipeline comment posted since carries
#     a line `<!-- agent-ops:reconciles comment=<id> -->` naming that human
#     comment's own issue-comment id. This is the one new convention
#     requirement 31c's refinement adds, and it sits on the Reviewer's side,
#     not the human's: prompts/reviewer.md's completion comment (step 8)
#     is expected to cite one such line per human comment it has answered,
#     whether by implementing the request or by explicitly contesting it —
#     "cite" rather than "detect", because whether a diff actually answers a
#     human's prose is exactly the judgement a script cannot make; a script can
#     only confirm the citation was made, the same division of labour
#     `lib/closing-keyword-gate.sh` already draws between the model's judgement
#     and the mechanism that checks it acted on it.
#
# Scoped to general PR comments only, not formal reviews or inline review
# comments: the human signal this exists for is a plain comment (PR #512's
# own words), a `REQUEST_CHANGES` review being unavailable to begin with (see
# above), and "issue-comment id" is the id space
# `<!-- agent-ops:reconciles comment=<id> -->` refers to.

# _reconciliation_gate_anchor SLUG NUMBER [NOT_AFTER]
# Print the timestamp comments are read "since": the pull request's most
# recent `ready_for_review` timeline event at or before NOT_AFTER that was
# never subsequently undone by a `convert_to_draft` event, itself at or
# before NOT_AFTER — or, when no such event exists (it had never left draft
# by then, a first round, or every flip on record was later reverted), its
# own creation time. Returns non-zero, printing nothing, only when the
# timeline itself could not be read at all; an empty but readable timeline is
# not a failure, it is the first-round case, and falls through to the
# creation-time read.
#
# ## Why NOT_AFTER exists, and why every real caller passes one
#
# "Most recent `ready_for_review` event" read literally is self-invalidating
# on the one path this gate was written for. `prompts/reviewer.md` step 7 has
# the Reviewer run `gh pr ready` itself, inside its own session; the gate runs
# afterwards, from `handoff_complete_review`, once that session has ended. So
# by the time the timeline is read, the most recent `ready_for_review` event
# is the Reviewer's *own* flip — and every human comment the round was
# supposed to answer, all of which necessarily predate it, falls before the
# anchor and is filtered out. Verified against PR #512's real timeline: the
# gate reported `clean` on exactly the scenario it exists to catch, and
# reported `dirty` on the same fixture with only that one event removed. The
# first-round fallback fails the same way, since the Reviewer's flip is also
# the *first* `ready_for_review` event on a never-yet-ready draft, so the
# creation-time branch stops applying at the same moment.
#
# NOT_AFTER is the round's own start (agent-cycle.sh passes `cycle_started_at`
# at both call sites): every flip this pipeline performs happens after it, and
# every flip that established the state the round inherited happened before
# it. Bounding the search there restores the anchor the requirement actually
# names — the moment the pull request last left draft *as the round found it*
# — without changing the rule for the paths that were already correct: on a
# `review-feedback` pull request, and on the Enabler's `complete_handoff`
# recovery path, no flip happens inside the round at all, so the bound selects
# the same event the unbounded read would have.
#
# ## Why a reverted flip must not win either (agent-ops#539)
#
# Bounding by NOT_AFTER alone is not enough once `handoff_complete_review`
# itself reverts a refused flip (`confirm_pr_draft`, agent-ops#539's fix to
# the bug this comment used to describe as merely "verified against PR #512's
# real timeline" without a second round). The reverted `ready_for_review`
# event is not deleted by that revert — GitHub keeps it on the timeline
# exactly where it was — so on the *next* round, unless it is specifically
# excluded, it is again the most recent `ready_for_review` event at or before
# the new bound, and the gate is fooled by its own refusal one round later:
# the human comment that caused the `dirty` verdict now falls before this
# stale anchor and reads as reconciled. Reproduced against PR #512's ordering
# extended with the revert `confirm_pr_draft` performs: round one is `dirty`
# (correctly), and round two — bounded past the revert — was `clean` before
# this fix and stays `dirty` after it (test/reconciliation-gate.test.sh).
#
# So a `ready_for_review` event only counts as "the pull request last left
# draft" here if no `convert_to_draft` event follows it at or before
# NOT_AFTER — i.e. it was never subsequently undone within the window this
# read is allowed to see. A `convert_to_draft` after NOT_AFTER (still in
# progress, or belonging to a later round) does not count against it, the
# same way a `ready_for_review` after NOT_AFTER already does not.
#
# Empty NOT_AFTER means unbounded, which is the pre-#533-fix behaviour and is
# kept only so a caller that genuinely has no round to bound by (a test
# asserting the raw rule) can ask for it. Passing one is not optional for a
# caller that runs after a flip it performed itself.
