# lib/workspace.sh — reclaiming `workspace_root`.
#
# Every cycle clones the repositories it touches into `workspace_root/<cycle-
# id>/` and deletes the clone in its exit trap. That trap is the whole of the
# cleanup, and a trap is exactly what a `SIGKILL` does not run: a cycle killed
# by the machine — an out-of-memory kill, a host freeze, a container recreate
# mid-stage — leaves its clone behind forever. Nothing else ever looks at
# `workspace_root` again, so the residue is invisible until the volume is full,
# and then it is the reason the volume is full (agent-ops#605).
#
# Measured on the two ockham nodes, 2026-08-24: 17 orphans, 4.2 GB, the oldest
# 32 days old. On VM1 the same day: 5 more, ~2.5 GB, the oldest 30 days.
#
# ## Why the rule is mtime and not the cycle-id convention
#
# The obvious reaper matches `workspace_root/<cycle-id>/` against the cycles it
# knows are dead. It would have missed the two largest orphans on the ockham
# nodes — `scratch-implementor/` (968 MB) and `scratch/` (101 MB) — and
# `20260803T105100Z-poetic-1-675091-scratch/` (74 MB) on VM1, because **the
# pipeline does not create those**. The stage agents do: a stage runs with its
# cwd inside the clone, is told by the repository's own `CLAUDE.md` to take a
# dedicated scratch clone rather than work in a checkout someone else may be
# editing, and picks its own name for it. That name is not the framework's to
# predict, and the next agent to invent a new one would silently defeat a
# reaper keyed on the convention.
#
# So the rule is a property instead: **anything directly under
# `workspace_root` that nothing has written to within the cycle-lock window
# cannot belong to a live cycle**. It needs no cooperation from whatever
# created the directory, and it holds for names nobody has thought of yet.
#
# The window is the one requirement 4f already derives from the stage budgets
# in force (`stage_budget_lock_seconds`, ~4 h for a cycle and ~6 h for a
# review, plus slack) — the same number `scripts/doctor.sh` reports — floored
# at 24 hours. The floor is not caution for its own sake: a review cycle and
# an implementation cycle hold separate locks and do run at once, so the
# window has to clear the longest thing that could legitimately be quiet
# beneath it. At 24 h it caught all 17 ockham orphans with no false positives,
# and the youngest was days past it.
#
# Freshness is read from the *tree*, never from the directory's own mtime: a
# clone's top-level mtime is stamped once, when git creates it, and does not
# move as a five-hour Implementer works inside. Reading it alone would reap
# the workspace of a running cycle.

# Removal goes through lib/stage-boundary.sh's `stage_workspace_remove`, which
# can also remove what a stage left that this user cannot (requirement 45e).
