# lib/disk-space.sh — free space on a directory's filesystem, read and judged
# one way everywhere: `scripts/doctor.sh`'s advisory warning and
# `agent-cycle.sh`'s pre-clone stand-down gate (requirement 2.0c, agent-ops#756)
# share this rather than each doing its own `df` arithmetic, so the two can no
# longer silently disagree about what "low" means.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# `doctor.sh` has read `workspace_root`'s free space and warned below a fixed
# 2 GiB since before this file existed — "a cycle clones every repository it
# touches" — but that warning only ever reached a human running `doctor.sh` by
# hand. The cycle itself cloned straight into whatever room was actually left.
# On the ockham laptop that ran out, a write truncated mid-flight left
# zero-length git objects in both nodes' state mirrors, permanently disabling
# `git gc` (#604) and leaving 4.2 GB of orphaned clones behind (#605) — a
# failure a gate ahead of the clone would have refused to start into.

# disk_space_free_kb PATH
# Free space on PATH's filesystem, in KiB (`df -Pk`'s own unit), or empty if
# it cannot be read — PATH does not exist, or `df` itself fails. Never prints
# `0` for "unreadable": a caller must be able to tell "definitely short" from
# "no idea", the same distinction `github_limit_verdict`'s `unknown` already
# draws for the GitHub budget check (lib/github-limit.sh).

# disk_space_same_filesystem PATH1 PATH2
# True (exit 0) iff PATH1 and PATH2 resolve to the same filesystem, in which
# case a caller judging both against one floor only needs to take one `df`
# reading — the common case, where `state_dir` and `workspace_root` sit under
# one home directory. False (exit 1) if they differ, or if either path's
# device id cannot be read: "cannot tell" is treated the same as "different",
# never as "same" — the cost of a redundant second reading is one extra `df`,
# the cost of wrongly treating two independent disks as one is a shortfall on
# the unread one going unnoticed.

# network blip never had, the same reasoning requirement 2.0's `unknown`
