# lib/claim.sh — atomic per-item claims, the lock that lets several nodes run
# cycles at once without doing the same work twice.
#
# The primitive is create-only: a claim is won by creating something that can
# exist exactly once, and GitHub arbitrates.
#
#   branch claims   a REST create-ref on the *target* repository
#                   (`POST /git/refs`), which returns 422 when the ref exists
#                   — even at the same SHA, which a plain `git push` of an
#                   identical ref would silently no-op ("Everything
#                   up-to-date", both racers convinced they won). The claim
#                   branch *is* the working branch: `agent/<item-ref>` for
#                   every source, tech-debt included.
#   file claims     a create-only contents-API PUT (no `sha`) in the state
#                   repository, for work that has no new branch to create:
#                   review-feedback amends an existing PR.
#
# Every won claim also writes a registry entry under `claims/<repo>/<key>.json`
# in the state repository — best-effort, advisory: the ref or file above is the
# lock; the registry is what back-pressure counts, the dashboard shows, and gc
# sweeps. The entry records the base SHA so a release deletes a claim branch
# only when it is exactly where the claim left it — pushed work is never
# deleted, whoever has to clean it up later.
#
#   claim.sh claim    branch <target-slug> <branch> <default-branch>
#   claim.sh claim    file   <target-slug> <key>
#   claim.sh release  branch <target-slug> <branch>   # ref iff unmoved+PR-less, then registry
#   claim.sh release  file   <target-slug> <key>      # registry only
#   claim.sh expire   <target-slug> <key>             # backdate ts; gc retires it next sweep
#   claim.sh count    <target-slug> [<counted-prs>]   # live registry entries, excluding any that name
#                                                      # a pull request <counted-prs> already counted
#   claim.sh claims   <target-slug>                   # registry entries younger than claim_ttl_hours,

#   claim.sh gc                                       # sweep entries older than claim_ttl_hours
#
# Exit codes: 0 won / done · 3 lost (someone else holds it) · 1 error.
# A caller treating 1 as "lost" fails closed — correct: a node that cannot
# reach GitHub to claim could not push the work either. `claims` and
# `branches` are read-only listings, not claim/release outcomes: each always
# prints a JSON array (empty on any read failure) and exits 0, because their
# caller (the Script, gathering fleet-wide claim visibility before the
# Co-Ordinator runs — requirement 3o) must never fail a cycle over a listing
# it can simply come up short on this once.
#
# Environment:
#   CLAIM_GH         override `gh` (tests stub it).
#   CLAIM_NODE       this node's name, recorded in the registry entry.
#   CLAIM_CYCLE      the claiming cycle's id, recorded in the registry entry.
#   CLAIM_ITEM       the work item, recorded in the registry entry.
#   CLAIM_SOURCE     the work source, recorded in the registry entry.
#   CLAIM_PR_NUMBER  the pull request this claim targets, when it targets one at
#                    all (issue #238): recorded in the registry entry as
#                    `pr_number` and surfaced by `claims`, so a file claim keyed
#                    `pr-<number>` — the second claim `agent-cycle.sh` takes
#                    alongside the item claim for the four finishing sources,
#                    the one that actually excludes a peer working the same PR
#                    under a different item ref — carries the number a reader
#                    can act on. Omitted (not recorded as `""`/`0`) when unset,
#                    so an ordinary branch claim's entry is unchanged.
#
# When `state_repo` is unset in config.json this is a single-node operation:
# file claims are vacuously won, the registry is skipped, and branch claims
# still work — the target repository exists regardless.
#
# One caller passes a pseudo-slug instead of a repository, and nothing here needs
# to know: the Enabler claims `file enabler <repo>__<item>__<blocked-epoch>`
# (implementation spec 35c), so its claims live under `claims/enabler/` where no
# target repo's can collide with them. Two properties of the code below are what
# make that safe, and both are worth not breaking. `count` reads only the slugs
# `config.json` configures, so an Enabler claim can never inflate back-pressure
# (requirement 2.2) with work that raises no PR — an invariant of *this* entry
# point, not of the registry, so a reader that walks the whole of `claims/`
# instead of asking here per repo has to re-impose it (the dashboard's
# back-pressure card did not, and read four tombstones as four open PRs). And
# `gc` sweeps whatever
# directories it finds, which is the *only* thing that retires those claims:
# they are deliberately never released, so a tombstone ageing out at
# `claim_ttl_hours` — or `expire`'s backdated `ts`, when the engagement that
# held it was itself discarded (issue #237) — is what lets a failed
# engagement be tried again.
