# fleet_peers_stale <peers_dir> [fetch_minutes]
# The one predicate for "is the peers directory's own freshness marker too
# old to trust" (#990) — shared by requirement 38b's `fleet_logs_healthy`
# below and the dashboard's fleet-strip badge, so the two can never disagree
# about what counts as stale. Exit 0 (stale) when the marker says `ok:false`
# (a real failure is in force, however long ago it started), or when it says
# `ok:true` but `ts` is older than the threshold (the fetch cron itself has
# stopped running, without ever logging a failure). Exit 1 (not stale) for a
# fresh `ok:true` marker or an absent one — no marker at all is the bootstrap
# case, not itself a failure, and the union's own emptiness already catches
# that node (`fleet_logs_healthy`'s own header).
#
# FETCH_MINUTES defaults to `schedule.state_sync_fetch_minutes`'s own default
# (7) — this library has no config reader of its own and should not grow one,

# scripts/publish-dashboard.sh) passes the configured value instead. The
# threshold is 3 fetch intervals, capped at LABEL_OWN_GRACE_SECONDS (#1053's
# principle: a staleness bound must never exceed the fault threshold it
# gates) — env-overridable as FLEET_PEERS_STALE_SECONDS, on the same

# fleet_repair_log <path> <node>
# A container killed mid-append can leave a log's size recorded while the
# data blocks behind the last few writes never reach disk: they read back as
# NUL bytes. One NUL makes the whole file binary to grep, which then stops
# printing matches for everything around it — so the damage is not the lost
# lines but every later read of whatever survived. Strip the NUL run and
# record what was dropped, rather than closing the gap silently: the loss is
# a fact about the node worth keeping.
#
# A JSONL target (PATH ending `.jsonl`) gets a JSON repair record so every
# `fromjson? // empty` reader still sees it; anything else (dashboard.log)
# gets the plain-text line that predates this generalisation. A plain-text
# line appended to a `.jsonl` file would be exactly what those readers
# silently drop, reproducing the same "loss recorded nowhere" failure this
# exists to close.
#
# A JSONL target needs more than the NUL bytes gone, because the run eats
# whatever those blocks held — the newline separators inside it included. Strip
# the bytes alone and what is left is the head of one record spliced onto the
# whole of a later one, on one line: `jq -s` still aborts over the join
# (`Expected separator between values` — the same refusal agent-ops#794 opened
# on, in different words), and every `fromjson? // empty` reader still drops the
# line with nothing saying so. Worse, a file whose tail was in flight when the
# stop came ends mid-record with no closing newline, so the repair record itself
# gets appended onto that stump and becomes the unparseable line — the one line
# whose whole job is to say something was lost.
#
# So for a JSONL target the run becomes a line break rather than nothing, and
# each resulting line survives only if it parses: the truncated stump goes, the
# intact record the run ran into is recovered whole, and the file is left
# something `jq -s` and an operator's grep can both read end to end. What went
# is counted (`dropped_lines`) beside the bytes.
#
# Cost when there is nothing to do (the normal case) is one read of PATH and
# no write; the rewrite is safe because every writer reopens by name per
# append, so none holds a descriptor across the rename.
