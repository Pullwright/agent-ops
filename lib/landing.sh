# lib/landing.sh — the deterministic eligibility classifier and the arming
# step (D18 WI-7, docs/reviews/2026-08-14-autonomy-investigation.md §5.1,
# §6, §7; agent-ops#410).
#
# This is the one place in the pipeline where a pull request's landing is
# armed without a human click — never a prompt's job (no model call happens
# anywhere in this file), and never a judgement call: every function below
# is plain code, printing a fixed vocabulary an interpreter never has to
# guess at. `landing_eligible` is the classifier (requirement 8d): given a
# pull request's already-resolved complexity, source and effective
# `merge_autonomy` level, does it qualify for automatic landing at all?
# `landing_arm` is the one write — enqueue where the base branch has a
# merge queue, `gh pr merge --auto --squash` where it does not — performed
# under the Approver App's own minted token, never the owner PAT, so the
# two-identity audit trail §5.3 exists for survives the write that actually
# lands a pull request, not only the review that approved it.
#
# ## The no-queue fallback does not always arm anything (agent-ops#553)
#
# `gh pr merge --auto --squash` reads as "arm auto-merge and let GitHub fire
# it later", but that is only true from `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` (a
# required check still pending) — the one state where it genuinely calls
# `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` and returns with the pull request still open.
# From `CLEAN` and `UNSTABLE` (every required check already passed, whether
# or not a non-required one is still running) `gh` instead detects the pull
# request is already mergeable and issues `mergePullRequest` directly, so
# the call merges it immediately rather than arming anything — confirmed
# live against `gh 2.96.0` (2026-08-18, agent-ops#553) with `GH_DEBUG=api`
# showing no `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` mutation sent from either state.
# Since `run_landing_stage` only ever reaches `landing_arm` once
# `review_gate_verdict` has already read `clean`, the immediate-merge path
# is the one this pipeline actually takes whenever the no-queue fallback
# fires at all. This is a property of the **`gh` CLI version**, not of the
# GitHub API — the `Pull request is in clean status` refusal older reports
# describe is a `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` error current `gh` simply never
# sends from an already-mergeable pull request — and `deploy/docker/
# Dockerfile` installs `gh` unpinned from GitHub's own apt repository (lines
# 85–93), so a later image rebuild can move this behaviour without any
# change in this file. `UNSTABLE`'s immediate merge carries its own
# behavioural caveat, filed separately as TD-PPagop-26082101.
#
# `agent-cycle.sh`'s own arming block (`run_landing_stage`, immediately
# after `run_approver_stage`) is what re-reads every other gate fresh at the
# moment of decision and calls these four functions; nothing in this file
# talks to `lib/review-gate.sh` or `lib/merge-budget.sh` directly, and
# nothing in this file decides whether the Approver *should* approve — only
# `landing_approver_standing_review` reads GitHub's own review list at all,
# and only to confirm a write `agent-cycle.sh` already decided to make
# actually landed (see that function's own header for why this round's
# in-process verdict is not proof enough on its own). Ships dormant: this
# file changes nothing about what a cycle does unless a caller reaches
# `landing_arm`, and the only caller (`run_landing_stage`) only reaches it
# once `merge_autonomy_effective_level` is `agent-merges-routine` or above —
# unset in every installation's `config.json` today (`merge_autonomy`'s own
# default is `human`), so this file is fully implemented and
# regression-tested (test/landing.test.sh) but
# otherwise inert until an operator raises the level (D16, §6).
#
# ## The protected-path list (risk register item 1)
#
# `landing_protected_paths_hit` is the second fence around ground the
# complexity grade already fences off once (`complexity:high` is forced for
# anything touching concurrency, security, CI/workflow machinery or shared
# library code — docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md requirement 26a, and
# `landing_eligible` already refuses anything above `complexity:medium`) —
# belt and braces against the deadliest class this design names: a pull
# request that edits the gate it is riding through the gate it just
# weakened. `merge_autonomy_protected_paths` (config, D18 Stage 3,
# agent-ops#724) names the list — a `repos[]` entry's own value overrides the
# top-level one, the same precedence `merge_autonomy_routine_sources` uses —
# matched the same way `scripts/is-docs-only.sh` matches its own allowlist
# (denylist here): an entry ending `/*` is a whole-path prefix, any other
# entry an exact path, never an extension rule. That file's own argument
# holds here unchanged: adding one line to a protected-paths list is cheap,
# forgetting one is not. Every installation defaults to agent-ops's own nine
# whole-path prefixes below, unless it names its own:
#
#   .github/     workflow definitions and branch-protection-adjacent config
#   deploy/      the node image and its compose/runbook
#   prompts/     the operating prompts every stage launches on
#   lib/         every sourced library this file itself lives in — see below
#   config.schema.json   the machine-readable statement of what config.json
#                may hold, including this file's own two new keys
#   config.json  the live configuration those keys are set in — the
#                `merge_autonomy` level and the routine-source list this
#                file's own gates read
#   agent-cycle.sh   the engine every stage runs inside, this arming step
#                included
#   review-cycle.sh  the review pipeline's own entry point
#   CODEOWNERS   who §5.3's ruleset lets the Approver App substitute for
#
# `lib/landing.sh` is self-protecting through the `lib/` prefix already —
# no separate entry names this file, because one already covers it and a
# redundant second entry is one more place to forget to update together.
# That reasoning is specific to agent-ops's own default list; a repository
# that overrides `merge_autonomy_protected_paths` takes over the job of
# covering whatever gates *its* own routine-tier landings — nothing here
# checks that an override actually does.
#
# The last three were left off when this list was first written, raised as
# an explicit question on this file's own pull request rather than decided
# here. That question has been answered: all three are on the list. Each is
# gate-bearing in the same direct sense as the entries above —
# `agent-cycle.sh` is the engine that calls this very arming step,
# `review-cycle.sh` is the review pipeline's entry point, and `config.json`
# carries the `merge_autonomy` level, `merge_autonomy_routine_sources` and
# `merge_autonomy_routine_complexity` that `landing_eligible` reads — so a
# pull request editing one of them is precisely the self-modifying case risk
# register item 1 names, and the "adding one line is cheap, forgetting one
# is not" argument above applies to them unchanged.
# Protected paths refuse arming at every level below `agent-merges-all`
# unconditionally. At `agent-merges-all` a hit is deliberately relaxed to
# `eligible` by `landing_eligible` itself, and the decision deferred to
# `landing_protected_path_controls_ok` — D18 WI-12's own compensating
# controls (§7 risk 1): the critical Approver tier, forced regardless of
# complexity (`run_approver_stage`, agent-cycle.sh), and a `landing_cool_off_hours`
# wait since that approval's own timestamp — measured only against a standing
# review whose own `commit_id` still matches the pull request's current head,
# so a push after approval restarts it — all re-read fresh at the moment of
# arming, never trusted from this round alone.
#
# ## The `SOURCE` comparison is a plain string, never a banded one
#
# `landing_eligible`'s `SOURCE` argument is compared against
# `merge_autonomy_routine_sources` by exact string equality, nothing more —
# confirmed against `agent-cycle.sh`'s own work-order construction
# (`selected_source`, set from the work order's `.source` field) and pinned
# by test/landing.test.sh rather than left to be re-discovered: every
# `issues:<band>` token in `repos[].sources` is a *config-time* rank
# (requirement 15e), but the four bands collapse to one plain `"issues"` the
# moment a candidate becomes a work order (`scripts/gather-issues.sh`,
# `"source": "issues"`) — the same collapse requirement 33's `first-seen`
# vocabulary already documents for all four bands.
#
# The comparison itself is unchanged, and deliberately so — no special case
# folding bands together lives here, which was the right call. What was
# wrong until agent-ops#558 was the *config vocabulary*: both this key and
# `repos[].sources` referenced one shared `sourceToken` enum, which offers
# the four banded spellings and no bare `issues`. So the only token that
# could ever match an issues work order was un-writable, and the four that
# were writable could never match — an installation widening its routine
# list to include issues got a config that validated and not one issue ever
# armed. agent-ops#519 (PR #554) caught the silence and added a doctor warn
# whose remedy reads "list `issues` itself" — correct advice the shared
# enum then rejected, which is how the gap survived being noticed: the
# warning and the schema each described half of a configuration that could
# not be written. Since #558 the key takes its own
# `landingSourceToken` enum: bare `issues`, no bands. A banded entry is now
# a schema error at load, which is the loud failure this quiet one deserved,
# and `scripts/doctor.sh` reads a bare `issues` in the routine list as
# gathered whenever the repository's own `sources` carry any `issues:<band>`
# (without that, its set-difference check would report the fix as a fault).
#
# The residual limitation is real but now honest, and stated in the schema:
# landing sees no band, so `issues` is all-or-nothing. An installation that
# wants only its low-band issues landed narrows what it *gathers*, not what
# it arms.
#
# ## Queue detection lives beside `merge_queue_probe`, not here
#
# `landing_arm`'s enqueue-vs-auto-merge choice reads
# `merge_queue_for_branch` (`lib/merge-queue.sh`) rather than a GraphQL
# query of its own — that file already owns every merge-queue GraphQL read
# in this codebase, and a second one here would be the same drift
# TD26071401 recorded for `lib/limit-detect.sh`'s two rate-limit detectors.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shell options are set here, matching every
# other lib/*.sh — the caller (`agent-cycle.sh` runs under
# `set -euo pipefail`; a test, `set -uo pipefail`) owns those. Depends on
# `github_pr_list_truncated` (lib/github-limit.sh) and `merge_queue_for_branch`
# (lib/merge-queue.sh), both already sourced ahead of this file by every
# caller.

# the caller's own already-resolved `merge_autonomy_effective_level` — this
# function never resolves it itself, so the kill switch and a WI-6 budget
# freeze both bind exactly once, at the caller, rather than being read
# twice and risking the two reads disagreeing.
#
# Eligible iff **all** of:
#   - LEVEL is `agent-merges-routine` or `agent-merges-all`;
#   - `landing_routine_eligible` says so (COMPLEXITY and SOURCE, above);
#   - `landing_protected_paths_hit` says no — below `agent-merges-all`. At
#     `agent-merges-all` a hit is instead reported `eligible` and deferred
#     to `landing_protected_path_controls_ok` (D18 WI-12), which needs
#     facts this function is never handed; see the hit branch's own comment
#     below.
#
# `unknown` is returned for `landing_protected_paths_hit`'s own exit 2 or 3
# — the changed-file list could not be read or was truncated (2), or the
# configured protected-paths list could not be evaluated against a changed
# path at all (3 — TD-PPagop-26082320) — and for any exit code outside its
# documented 0/1/2/3 contract (e.g. 128+n from the command-substitution
# subshell being signal-killed mid-gate, agent-ops#1232), which fails closed
# the same way rather than falling through to the legitimate 1's `eligible`
# arm. Every other refusal above is a deterministic `ineligible`, since
# COMPLEXITY, SOURCE and LEVEL are all already in the caller's hand, nothing
# further to ask GitHub. All three carry the same instruction to every call
# site: **never a pass** — `unknown` is treated as `ineligible` everywhere
# this is read; the distinction between the two documented causes exists so
# the `unknown:` reason names which was true (TD-PPagop-26082325) — a
# malformed `merge_autonomy_protected_paths` sends whoever reads it to their
# own `config.json`, an unreadable changed-file list sends them to `gh`
# instead, and conflating the two into one wording sent every reader to the
# wrong place; an out-of-contract exit code names neither, since it is

# The D18 WI-12 Stage 4 compensating controls (§7 risk 1) a protected-path
# pull request at `agent-merges-all` must additionally clear before
# `_landing_stage_attempt` arms it, once `landing_eligible` has already
# deferred the decision here. Print `ok`, `ineligible:<reason>` or
# `unknown:<reason>` — never a pass on anything this cannot establish.
#
# Re-reads `landing_protected_paths_hit` itself rather than trust the
# caller's own earlier read (never more than one function call old, the same
# discipline every other landing gate follows): a pull request not actually
# touching a protected path is `ok` immediately, since neither control below
# applies to it. TIER, SUBMITTED_AT and REVIEW_COMMIT are the caller's own
# facts about the Approver's already-*standing* review — never re-derived
# here: TIER is either `run_approver_stage`'s own in-process fact (the round
# that first approved this pull request) or read back from the fleet log's
# own `approver-verdict` event (`landing_retry_tier`, a re-arm on a later
# cycle); SUBMITTED_AT and REVIEW_COMMIT are `landing_approver_standing_review_at`'s
# own timestamp and `commit_id`, already fetched fresh by the same gate that
# confirmed the review is standing `APPROVED`. Only `critical` satisfies the
# tier control — an adjudication settled by a refuse-streak counts exactly
# the same as an ordinary engagement forced critical by the protected path
# itself, since both mean the pull request actually got the critical-tier
# scrutiny Stage 4 requires, whichever cause `run_approver_stage`'s own
# `critical_reason` names for the log.
#
# The cool-off is only ever measured against a review that still covers the
# pull request's *current* code: REVIEW_COMMIT (the standing review's own
# `commit_id`) is checked against a fresh read of the pull request's own
# `headRefOid` before `submitted_at` is trusted for anything. A push after
# approval moves the head without touching the standing review at all —
# nothing in this pipeline dismisses a stale review on push — so a mismatch
# here is the only signal a later push ever leaves, and it refuses outright
# rather than measuring a cool-off against a timestamp that no longer speaks
# for the code actually sitting on the branch. There is no fresher
# `submitted_at` to restart the clock from until the Approver reviews the new
# head and a later gate-4 read finds a `commit_id` that matches again — until
# then this control simply never clears, which is what "a fresh push
# restarts the wait" means in practice: the wait does not resume where it
# left off, it starts over from an unmet state.

#   7 — `gh pr merge --auto --squash` failed
#
# Two reads precede the one write, both under whatever ambient `gh`
# identity the caller already runs as (never TOKEN — they write nothing,

#   - the pull request's own GraphQL node id and current base branch

#   - `merge_queue_for_branch SLUG BASE` (lib/merge-queue.sh) — null means
#     no queue.
#
# The write itself runs under TOKEN as a leading one-invocation assignment
# — `GH_TOKEN="$token" "$gh_bin" …`, never `export` — exactly as
# `approver_post_review` (lib/approver.sh) does and for the reason its own

# `{repo, item, source, model, title, branch}`, verbatim regardless of which
# source it came from (a fresh item or a finishing one). Read back here so the
# 2.1e landing-retry sweep (TD-PPagop-26081701) can call `landing_eligible`
# with the same fact the round that first approved this pull request used,
# for a repository and branch its own process never claimed and so has no
# `$selected_source` for.
#
# This is the one fact `_landing_stage_attempt`'s gates read from the fleet
# log rather than fresh from GitHub, and deliberately so: unlike every other
# gate (a review, a check, the budget, the queue), a pull request's source is
# fixed at claim time and never mutates over its life — GitHub carries no
# field for it at all — so the log's own append-only record of the one
# `selection` event that raised this branch is exactly as current as a fresh
# read would be, for a fact that cannot go stale.
#
# LOG_FILE is the fleet's own union log (`$union_log`, built once per cycle
# from every node's synced log — see agent-cycle.sh's own "1a. The fleet's
# memory"), or stdin if omitted or "-", matching every reader in
# lib/cycle-state.sh. Malformed lines are skipped, not fatal (`fromjson? //
# empty`, the same tolerant-line convention `blocked_items` uses); several
# `selection` events for the same repo/branch keep only the most recent
# (`sort_by(.ts) | last`) — a branch this system reuses (a tech-debt item's
# `td/<ID>` retried under a fresh claim) still resolves to its current claim,
# never a stale one. Empty on no match, an unreadable log, or nothing to
# read — the sweep must skip a candidate it cannot classify, never guess at

# (requirement 8x, agent-ops#578): a pull request a refuse streak sent
# through more than one Approver engagement carries every one of them here,
# not only the round that finally approved it. The record's own `approver`
# object is this array's *last* entry, exactly as `landing_retry_tier` reads
# the newest matching event's `tier` alone — never a separate in-process
# fact, so the same read serves both the round that first approves a pull
# request and a later 2.1e landing-retry re-arm without the two ever risking
# disagreement.
#
# Reads the union of SRC1 and SRC2, deduplicated — never either alone. On the
# round that first approves a pull request, `$log_file` (this process's own
# just-written `approver-verdict` event is already there — `log_event`
# appends synchronously, before `_landing_stage_attempt` ever runs) misses
# any peer node's refusal that only ever reached the fleet's `$union_log`
# snapshot (built once at cycle start, so it never carries this round's own
# just-written event either); on a 2.1e landing-retry re-arm, `$union_log`
# alone would equally miss nothing new, since the approving round belongs to
# an earlier cycle and is already folded into it. Neither source alone is
# ever the full history for either round, which is why both callers now pass
# `$union_log` as SRC1 and `${log_file:-}` as SRC2 unconditionally. SRC1 may
# be "-" for stdin (matching every reader in lib/cycle-state.sh); SRC2, if
# given, is always a path, never stdin. Either argument may be a missing,
# empty or unreadable path — that source simply contributes nothing. Rows
# are deduplicated on the whole emitted object (SRC1 and SRC2 commonly
# overlap on this node's own events), not `.ts` alone, since two distinct
# events can share a timestamp. Malformed lines are skipped, not fatal.
# Always prints a JSON array, `[]` rather than empty output, so a caller can

# The arming step's own gate 0 (D18 WI-7,
# docs/reviews/2026-08-14-autonomy-investigation.md §5.1, §6, §7; requirement
# 8d). Called immediately after `run_approver_stage` — deliberately after,
# not folded into it: `run_approver_stage` is the review, and every failure
# mode `_landing_stage_attempt` has of its own (a budget hold, a protected
# path, a queue race) must never be confused for "the Approver refused to
# review", which requirement 8c's own `approver-verdict` event already
# speaks for.
#
# Arms nothing at all unless this very round's Approver engagement reached
# an explicit, non-adjudicating `approve` — read from `approver_stage_verdict`/
# `approver_stage_adjudicating`, the globals `run_approver_stage` set
# immediately before returning (never reused beyond this one read). Once that
# holds, every other gate is `_landing_stage_attempt`'s job — the same
# function the 2.1e landing-retry sweep calls for a pull request this gate
# already passed once, on a later cycle, for a repo and source this global
# scope does not carry (TD-PPagop-26081701; see that function's own header).
#
# Passes `landing_armed_by_repo[$selected_repo]` as ALREADY_ARMED (PR #557
# review round 2) rather than leaving it at `_landing_stage_attempt`'s own
# default of 0: the 2.1e sweep (`_landing_retry_sweep_repo`, run earlier this
# same cycle, well before this stage) may already have armed candidates for
# this repository, and this stage's own live `merge_budget_decide` read must
# discount those too, not just its own — the gap PR #557's first review round

# _landing_stage_attempt SLUG PR_URL COMPLEXITY SOURCE DEFAULT_BRANCH [RETRY] [ALREADY_ARMED]
# The seven re-read-fresh gates the arming step re-reads before landing a pull
# request — extracted out of `run_landing_stage` (TD-PPagop-26081701) so the
# 2.1e landing-retry sweep can reuse the identical, single-source-of-truth
# sequence for a pull request outside the round that first approved it,
# rather than a second copy that could drift from what this one actually
# does. SLUG, SOURCE and DEFAULT_BRANCH are parameters rather than
# `$selected_repo`/`$selected_source`/`$gate_default_branch` for exactly that
# reason: the retry sweep runs fleet-wide, for a repository, an originating
# work-order source and a default branch none of those globals carry this
# cycle. RETRY, when non-empty, is threaded through to `_landing_refuse` and
# the final `landing-armed` log as `retry: true` — see that function's own
# header. ALREADY_ARMED (default 0; PR #557 review of TD-PPagop-26081701) is
# forwarded to `merge_budget_decide` verbatim (gate 5 below) — how many pull
# requests this repository has already been armed for earlier in this same
# cycle, by either caller, and therefore how far this candidate's own live
# budget read must be discounted before it can arm another; both callers read
# and grow the same cycle-scoped `landing_armed_by_repo[SLUG]` (declared
# ahead of both, PR #557 review round 2) rather than a tally of their own, so
# a repository's remaining budget is never double-spent across the sweep and
# this round's own arming step just because neither call site knew what the
# other had already armed. Sets the global `_landing_stage_attempt_armed`
# to `1` immediately after a successful arm and to `0` at every other return
# (including every refusal) — the one signal a caller can use to grow its own
# running ALREADY_ARMED count for the next candidate, since this function's
# own exit status stays `0` on every path (a refusal costs a `landing-refused`
# event, never a non-zero return) and cannot carry that.
#
# Everything below is re-read fresh from GitHub, the discipline
# `lib/review-gate.sh` established, because nothing this stage arms may
# trust state more than one function call old:
#
#   1. `merge_autonomy_effective_level`, called with `fresh` (issue #513) so
#      the kill switch bypasses this process's own memo — must still be
#      `agent-merges-routine` or `agent-merges-all` (the kill switch or a
#      budget freeze may have moved since the Approver ran). A refusal here
#      names its actual cause (`landing_autonomy_refusal_reason`, D18 issue
#      #576) — the fleet-wide kill switch, distinguishable in the
#      `landing-refused` log from a repository that simply never had its
#      level raised — rather than always blaming "the level", which a human
#      reading the log has no reason to suspect they set correctly.
#   2. `landing_eligible` (lib/landing.sh) — complexity, source and the
#      protected-paths classifier.
#   2.5. `landing_open_question_hit` (lib/landing.sh, requirement 8f, D18,
#      agent-ops#668) — the `open-question` label the Reviewer's own
#      `open_questions` verdict projects must not be standing. A hit does not
#      merely refuse: `_landing_open_question_resolve` runs the
#      `escalation_autonomy` ladder for it (an escalation issue, or one
#      bounded adjudication pass first), and only a `settled` verdict lets
#      this round fall through to gate 3. Unlike every other unreadable
#      here, an unreadable label list refuses in the plain "could not read"
#      wording rather than routing into that ladder — see that function's
#      own header for why a question never confirmed to exist must not
#      summon anybody.
#   3. `review_gate_verdict` — must read `clean`; `dirty` and `unknown`
#      both refuse (stricter than the ordinary ready-gate handoff, which
#      tolerates an alerts-only `unknown` as a warning — arming an
#      automatic merge does not).
#   4. The Approver App's own review is genuinely standing `APPROVED` on
#      GitHub right now (`landing_approver_standing_review_at`,
#      lib/landing.sh)
#      — never inferred from this round's own `approver_stage_verdict`
#      alone: `approver_post_or_warn` always returns 0 even when the write
#      itself failed ("a missing review, never a stranded PR"), so a local
#      `approve` verdict is this process's *intent*, not GitHub's own
#      record — and no human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` stands
#      (`_handoff_blocking_reviewers`, lib/handoff.sh, requirement 34a's own
#      standing-position computation, reused for the human half rather than
#      re-derived). Both are fresh reads: a token that expired between
#      minting and posting, or a push/review submitted after the Approver
#      ran, are exactly the facts this step must catch.
#
#      Neither read sees a plain comment: a human cannot leave a formal
#      `REQUEST_CHANGES` review on this system's own pull requests at all
#      (GitHub refuses that review type from a pull request's own author, and
#      every pipeline write and every human comment here land under the same
#      account), so their only instrument is an ordinary comment, and
#      `_handoff_blocking_reviewers` reads only formal reviews. #533 closed
#      that gap at the Reviewer's own ready-flip
#      (`lib/reconciliation-gate.sh`'s `reconciliation_gate`, requirement
#      31c): a pull request carrying an unreconciled comment since it last
#      left draft cannot be flipped Ready in the first place. That gate runs
#      once, at hand-off, and never reaches here — a plain comment posted
#      after a pull request is already Ready, in the window before a later
#      cycle's arming step lands it, was answered by neither mechanism
#      (agent-ops#672). Gate 4 closes that residual window by calling
#      `reconciliation_gate` itself, a second time, right here: unbounded (no
#      NOT_AFTER), since this stage never flips the pull request out of draft
#      itself the way the Reviewer's own call must guard against — the real
#      current "last left draft, and stayed left" anchor is exactly the one
#      this arming read needs, not one bounded away from a flip of its own.
#      `dirty` refuses arming, naming the unreconciled comment(s); anything
#      else that is not `clean` — `unknown`, where the timeline or comment
#      list could not be read, and the empty word a call that never ran at
#      all leaves behind — refuses too (#753's ruling on #746): neither
#      should ever pass a safety gate, unlike the Reviewer's own
#      reconciliation read at hand-off (`handoff_complete_review`), which
#      does tolerate an `unknown` there as non-blocking — this arming-time
#      instance is stricter by design. Because every non-`clean` word now
#      refuses before this function can reach an arm, the landing audit
#      record (requirement 8x) never carries a `comment-reconciliation`
#      entry reading anything but `clean`.
#   4.5. D18 WI-12 (Stage 4, agent-ops#415): only at `agent-merges-all`, and
#      only for a pull request `landing_protected_path_controls_ok`
#      (lib/landing.sh) itself confirms still touches a protected path —
#      gate 2's own `landing_eligible` already deferred rather than refused
#      that case. Requires the approving engagement to have run at the
#      critical Approver tier, the standing review's own `commit_id` (gate
#      4's own `landing_approver_standing_review_at` read, no extra `gh`
#      call) to still match a fresh read of the pull request's current
#      `headRefOid`, and the configurable `landing_cool_off_hours` wait
#      since that review's own `submitted_at` to have elapsed. A push after
#      approval moves `headRefOid` without touching the standing review at
#      all — nothing here dismisses a stale review — so a `commit_id`
#      mismatch refuses outright rather than measuring a cool-off against a
#      timestamp that no longer speaks for the code on the branch; this is
#      the sense in which a fresh push restarts the wait, since nothing
#      resumes it until a later review matches the new head. TIER comes from
#      this round's own `approver_stage_tier` on the first-approval round, or
#      `landing_retry_tier`'s fleet-log read on a retry — never re-derived.
#   5. `merge_budget_decide`/`merge_budget_apply_decision`
#      (lib/merge-budget.sh) — only `arm` proceeds; `hold` and `refuse` are
#      applied and stop here.
#   6. `merge_queue_probe` — the pull request must not already be queued,
#      and must never have been queued and removed without being re-queued
#      since (`merge_queue_dequeue_actionable`, lib/merge-queue.sh, PR #557
#      review of TD-PPagop-26081701, distinguishes only the refusal wording —
#      never re-arms either way; `scripts/gather-dequeued.sh`'s own source
#      owns a `failed_checks` dequeue, and a human's own `manual` one is
#      never this stage's to reverse). "Could not read" is "possibly queued
#      or dequeued", so it refuses too.
#
# Any read above that cannot be answered is a refusal (`_landing_refuse`,
# `landing-refused`), never a pass. Every REASON this function or its own
# helpers hand to `_landing_refuse` carries a short, GitHub-URL-free class
# word ahead of its own first `:` — `landing_eligible`'s and
# `landing_protected_path_controls_ok`'s `ineligible:`/`unknown:`,
# `landing_autonomy_refusal_reason`'s `kill-switch:`, gate 3's own
# `review gate:`, this function's own `malformed-pr-url:`/
# `open-question-unreadable:`/`approver-review-unreadable:`/
# `approver-review-not-approved:`/`human-veto-unreadable:`/
# `human-changes-requested:`/`reconciliation-unanswered:`/
# `reconciliation-unreadable:`/`merge-queue-unreadable:`/
# `dequeued-actionable:`/`dequeued-manual:`/`arm-failed:` — so
# `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh`'s landings digest (`byReason`,
# `dashboard/index.html`) groups by that word rather than by the text before
# whatever colon happens to occur first, which for a sentence-form refusal
# embedding `$pr_url` (itself a `https://…` string) is the URL's own scheme
# colon (TD-PPagop-26082502). A message carrying no colon at all, and so no
# varying content a split could cut it off at — "could not read the Approver
# App's own login", "already in the merge queue", "could not mint the
# Approver's installation token", `landing_autonomy_refusal_reason`'s plain
# "effective level is …" — needs no prefix: the whole string is already a
# stable, single group. A successful arm logs `landing-armed`
# exactly once, naming the method (`enqueued`/`auto-merge`) `landing_arm`
# actually used, and never withholds anything requirement 8b already did —
# the *first* attempt (RETRY empty) runs strictly after the `pr-ready` log
# and the claim release, and nothing here can affect either; a retry attempt

# agent-ops#578) — one durable record of everything that justified landing
# this pull request without a human act anywhere in the chain, assembled
# here rather than reconstructed later by joining separate events at report
# time (the WI-8 digest's own former failure mode: a landing whose verdict
# could not be found rendered with nulls rather than saying so). It carries
# the pull request's own number and `review_commit_sha` (the Approver's
# standing review's own `commit_id`, already in hand from gate 4 — never a
# fresh read for a fact this cheap to reuse; the commit the Approver approved,
# not necessarily the commit that actually merged), the effective
# `merge_autonomy` level and whether SLUG's own `repos[]` entry or the
# top-level key produced it (`merge_autonomy_resolution_source`,
# lib/merge-autonomy.sh — reached only once gate 1 has already confirmed the
# kill switch is clear and no budget freeze binds, so no fresher read is
# needed), the protected-path verdict and the protected paths it hit
# (`landing_protected_paths_hit`, read fresh once more here — the same
# "never more than one function call old" discipline gate 4.5's own
# `landing_protected_path_controls_ok` already applies to the same
# primitive, rather than trust gate 2's now-discarded read), the Approver's
# tier/model/verdict/adjudication and this pull request's full adjudication
# history (`landing_approver_adjudication_history`, lib/landing.sh — the
# fleet log's own record of every `approver-verdict` event this pull request
# ever received, not only the one that authorised this landing), every
# deterministic gate this function itself just passed with its own
# evidence — including the human-veto gate's own `blocking_reviewers` list
# (`_handoff_blocking_reviewers`'s return at gate 4, empty on every arm),
# carried beside that gate's verdict the same way the top-level
# `protected_path` object already names the paths it examined — the
# `merge_budget_decide` object gate 5 already computed and would otherwise
# discard the moment `decision == "arm"` was confirmed, and the landing
# mechanism `landing_arm` actually used. `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh`'s
# WI-8 digest reads this record instead of re-joining `approver-verdict`
# events against `landing-armed`, and reports a `landing-armed` with no

# ITEM (requirement 49, issue #595) is `$selected_item` on `run_landing_stage`'s

# claimed has no in-process fact to read). Carried on `landing-armed` and

# evidence logged) over a Reviewer's own open question against PR_URL — a
# fresh, narrow engagement at the Approver's own critical tier
# (`approver_model_critical`, the tier D18 §5.2 already reserves for
# litigated judgement), never `enabler_model`: the question is about whether
# this pull request's own diff and work order already answer it, the
# Approver's own ground, not a refinement disagreement.
#
# Distinct from requirement 8c's own refuse-streak adjudication in every way
# that requirement's own text calls for: different trigger (an open question
# stands, never a refuse streak), different prompt (`prompts/approver-
# adjudicate-open-question.md`, never `prompts/approver.md`), different
# input (the question and its own comment, never prior refusal bodies), and
# never conflated in the log — `open-question-adjudication` is its own
# event, carrying `adjudication: true` on the same footing as
# `enabler-adjudication`, never `approver-verdict`.
#
# Prints `{"verdict": "settled"|"escalate", "evidence": "...", "answer":
# "..."}` on stdout — `answer` is present only on `settled`, the text posted
# to the pull request. A missing prompt file, a disabled critical tier, a
# stage failure, or an unparseable verdict all print `escalate` with an

# _landing_retry_sweep_repo SLUG RETRY_LOGIN
# One repository's own pass of the 2.1e landing-retry sweep
# (TD-PPagop-26081701) — every candidate this repository currently has,
# offered to `_landing_stage_attempt` with `RETRY` set. See that requirement
# for the full design; this function is the candidate rule alone:
#
#   - Same FRESH discipline every other landing read uses (issue #513): a
#     repository the kill switch or a budget freeze currently holds at
#     `human`/`agent-approves` is skipped before any further GitHub call —
#     `_landing_stage_attempt` would refuse every candidate on this gate
#     alone, so asking is pure cost for a repository this sweep cannot act
#     on regardless.
#   - A candidate is open, non-draft, carries `pr_label`, and its own
#     `complexity:*` label reads `low` or `medium` (never `high` — the
#     cheapest of the seven gates to pre-check, from data already fetched here,
#     so a permanently-ineligible pull request costs one list call per
#     repository per cycle rather than the changed-file read
#     `landing_eligible` would otherwise repeat forever).
#   - Only a pull request the Approver has genuinely, currently approved is
#     this sweep's business (`landing_approver_standing_review`, the same
#     fresh read `_landing_stage_attempt`'s own gate 4 makes) — one never
#     reviewed (still mid-Reviewer, or `run_approver_stage` never ran for it)
#     is not a stranded approval, it is ordinary in-flight work, and logging
#     a `landing-refused` against it every cycle would be pure noise.
#   - `landing_retry_source` (lib/landing.sh) resolves the pull request's
#     originating `source` from the fleet's own union log (`$union_log`) —
#     the one fact this sweep cannot re-read fresh from GitHub, because
#     GitHub carries no field for it and a pull request's source is fixed at
#     claim time regardless. A pull request whose source cannot be resolved
#     this cycle (the claim predates this node's log window, or the union
#     log itself could not be read) is skipped, never guessed at.
#
# Every remaining gate — level, eligibility, review, budget, queue, the arm
# itself — is `_landing_stage_attempt`'s alone; this function never repeats
# or second-guesses any of them, with one exception it must carry itself
# (PR #557 review of TD-PPagop-26081701): `merge_budget_decide`'s own count
# is GitHub's *merged*-PR record, which a pull request this same pass just
# armed does not join synchronously, so a naive per-candidate call would read
# every candidate against the same stale count and arm all of them regardless
# of the cap — 12 stranded approved pull requests each reading `count=0`
# against `merge_budget_per_day: 8`, say, all twelve arming, and the *next*
# cycle's own budget read then seeing 12 merged against a cap of 8 and
# tripping the counting-anomaly freeze against an operator who did nothing
# wrong. `armed_this_pass` below starts from — and, on every arm, writes
# back to — the cycle-scoped `landing_armed_by_repo[$slug]` (declared ahead
# of this function, PR #557 review round 2) rather than a tally private to
# this one pass: `run_landing_stage`'s own gate 0, called later the same
# cycle for whatever repository this round's own Implementer worked in,
# reads and grows the identical global, so a repository this sweep already
# armed candidates for cannot then have that round's own arming step push it
# one past `merge_budget_per_day` on a live count neither call site's own
# pass-local tally would have caught alone. Grown here (read off
# `_landing_stage_attempt`'s own `_landing_stage_attempt_armed` global
# immediately after each call, the one signal that function's own always-0
# exit status cannot carry) exactly as before within one pass; only the
# variable it starts from and feeds back into is no longer private to this
# function.

# landing_open_question_label_project SLUG NUMBER
# Put $LANDING_OPEN_QUESTION_LABEL on pull request #NUMBER in SLUG iff it is
# not already there, and say whether the resulting label is this
# projection's to remove later. Mirrors `refinement_label_project`'s
# (lib/refinement.sh) read-before-write contract exactly, for the identical
# reason: `gh pr edit --add-label` succeeds as a no-op on a pull request that
# already carries the label, so an unconditional add-and-record would let
# `landing_open_question_label_release` later remove a label a human applied
# for their own reasons before this question was ever raised.
#
# Prints one word:
#   added       LABEL was absent and is now on the pull request — record it,
#               so settling the question takes it off again.
#   present     LABEL was already there. Nothing is touched and nothing must
#               be recorded — most often a later Reviewer round raising a
#               further question while an earlier one still stands.
#   unrecorded  the pull request's labels could not be read, so the add was
#               attempted best-effort but must not be recorded — over-holding
#               a label is cosmetic; removing one that may have pre-existed
#               is the defect this function exists to prevent.
#   failed      the list was readable, LABEL was absent, and the add would
#               not take (a repo where the label was never created is the
#               practical case, ordinarily self-healed by `labels_ensure`'s
#               own periodic sweep, lib/labels.sh) — the caller records the
#               question regardless: losing the label costs a filter, losing
#               the gate would cost the hold.
#
# Exit status is 0 for `added` and `present`, 1 for `unrecorded` and `failed`.

# landing_open_question_latest PR_URL [SRC]
# Every question a Reviewer round has logged against PR_URL via
# `open-question-raised`, deduplicated by its own `question` text — never
# only the most recent round's, so a second round raising a further question
# while an earlier one still stands does not silently drop the first from an
# escalation issue's body or an adjudication pass's own input (agent-ops#668
# design point: "whether more than one open question per pull request is
# permitted" — yes, and every one of them is carried forward). `[]` if none
# is on the log SRC names.
#
# SRC follows `landing_approver_adjudication_history`'s own convention:
# `$log_file` on the round that first raises a question (this process's own
# just-written `open-question-raised` event is already there) or
# `$union_log` when read back later (a peer node's or an earlier cycle's
# round), or stdin if omitted or "-". Malformed lines are skipped, not
# fatal. This is read-only, supplementary content for prose a human or an
# adjudication pass reads — never what the landing gate itself decides on,
# which stays the label alone (requirement 8f's own "no log join" reasoning
# for the gate proper), so a peer node's cycle racing to log its own
# `open-question-raised` event costs this reader nothing but slightly stale
# prose.
