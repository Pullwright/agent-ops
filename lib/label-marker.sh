# lib/label-marker.sh — the pipeline's own memory of the label actions it has
# taken, the counterpart to `lib/pipeline-marker.sh`'s comment marker (#222)
# for the one write a marker cannot reach: a label carries no hidden text to
# stamp, so an add or a remove leaves nothing on the object itself
# distinguishing this system's own hand from a human's — even though, exactly
# as with a comment, both happen under the one GitHub account this system runs
# as (requirement 9d).
#
# `needs_refinement_label`'s hand-flag path (requirement 34g,
# `refinement_hand_flag_new`) already avoids the obvious version of this bug:
# an issue the Script just labelled is, by construction, already blocked, so
# the "not already blocked" test excludes it without needing to know who
# applied the label. What it cannot catch is the case that test is blind to on
# purpose — a *removal* that silently failed (a rate limit, a permissions
# blip; `refinement_label_remove` already tolerates this, by design, per
# `release_refinement_label`'s own comment) leaves the label sitting on an
# issue whose block has since cleared. The next cycle's hand-flag scan finds
# it labelled, finds no open block, and — without this file — reads that
# exactly like a human asking for one, restarting a block nobody asked for.
# This is that RC4 fleet incident (`docs/reviews/2026-08-07-…`): the pipeline
# unable to tell its own label writes from the human's, each round costing an
# engagement.
#
# The fix is the same shape as the comment marker's, adapted to what a label
# can carry: nothing on the object, so the memory lives in the shared log
# instead. Every add or remove the Script performs is logged as an
# `own-label-action` event; a reader compares GitHub's own record of when the
# label was last applied (`gather-hand-flagged-refinements.sh`'s `labelled_at`)
# against this file's record of when *we* last touched it. If ours is the
# later — or the same — action, the current state is explained without a
# human ever touching the label, and no read-back mechanism may treat it as
# one.
#
# The record is written at the call site (agent-cycle.sh), not inside
# `lib/refinement.sh`'s `refinement_label_add`/`_remove`: those stay pure `gh`
# wrappers, the same "library stays a pure function" boundary
# `stage_budget_overrides` documents for its own config read. This file holds
# only the read-back half — a pure function of the log, like every other
# extract in `lib/cycle-state.sh`.
#
# #526: comparing "ours" and GitHub's clocks directly is not enough. A node
# whose clock runs behind GitHub's can stamp `own.ts` earlier than the
# `labelled_at` it caused, which the original exact-order comparison read as
# a human's later touch; and the `own-label-action` record a peer node just
# wrote has not necessarily reached the node doing the read-back yet, since
# it arrives by the fleet's periodic state-sync rather than synchronously.
# The read-back below instead (1) matches any recorded `add` within a skew
# tolerance of `labelled_at`, in either direction, rather than requiring
# ours to be no later than GitHub's, and (2) treats a label applied more
# recently than a grace period as *not yet attributable* when no own record
# explains it — neither a hand-flag nor a stale write to retry — rather than
# assuming the silence means a human, since the record may simply not have
# propagated yet. See `own_class` below for the three-way classification
# this produces, shared verbatim by every reader so they cannot drift into
# disagreeing about which class a candidate falls into.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh. Sets no shell options, because agent-cycle.sh
# runs under `set -euo pipefail`.

# How long a node's clock may disagree with GitHub's (LABEL_OWN_SKEW_TOLERANCE_SECONDS)
# and how long an own-label-action record may take to propagate from the
# writing node to the reading one over the fleet's periodic state-sync
# (LABEL_OWN_GRACE_SECONDS). Both env-overridable, like every other pipeline
# timing constant (e.g. `GITHUB_LIMIT_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS`), so a test can
# substitute a value that reads clearly without touching production
# behaviour. Production values: 120s comfortably exceeds every skew measured
# on this fleet (13s and 5+s in opposite directions, per #526); 1800s
# comfortably exceeds the ~12 minutes of state-sync staleness #526 measured
# against a ~6-7 minute fetch cadence.
LABEL_OWN_SKEW_TOLERANCE_SECONDS="${LABEL_OWN_SKEW_TOLERANCE_SECONDS:-120}"
LABEL_OWN_GRACE_SECONDS="${LABEL_OWN_GRACE_SECONDS:-1800}"

# The classification `label_filter_own_applications` and
# `label_own_stale_applications` below embed verbatim, so the two can never
# drift into disagreeing about which of three classes a candidate falls
# into:
#
#   "ours"      — an own `add` for this repo+item+label is recorded within
#                 LABEL_OWN_SKEW_TOLERANCE_SECONDS of `labelled_at`, in
#                 either direction, regardless of what the *latest* recorded
#                 action is — so an add that matches, followed by a remove
#                 that silently failed, still reads as ours (#526 cause 2).
#   "deferred"  — no own record explains the label, but `labelled_at` is
#                 newer than LABEL_OWN_GRACE_SECONDS ago: the absence may
#                 simply mean the writing node's record has not reached this
#                 node yet (#526 cause 1), so this is neither reported as a
#                 hand-flag nor offered up for a stale-removal retry.
#   "not-ours"  — everything else: the label is old enough, or the own
#                 record present and not near enough, that a human's own
#                 hand is the remaining explanation. This is the fail-safe
#                 default requirement 39f always used before #526 — an
#                 unreadable log, a malformed argument, or a missing
#                 `labelled_at` all resolve here too.
#
# A legacy `$own` object carrying only `{action, ts}` (rather than
# `label_own_actions_map`'s richer `{action, ts, adds}`) is still matched
# correctly: `own_add_near` treats `action == "add"` with its `ts` as an
# implicit single-element `adds`, so a caller (or a test) that builds an
# own-record by hand doesn't need to know about `adds` at all.

# so the two can never disagree about which entries are which. Where that
# function answers "what a human might be asking about", this one answers
# "what is safe to retry removing": a label this system recorded a matching
# `add` for, still present on the issue only because a previous removal
# attempt (`release_refinement_label`, which tolerates the failure by
# design) did not take. Requirement 39f's read-back keeps such an entry from
# being misread as a fresh flag; this is the other half — handing it back so
# the call site can have another go at the removal itself, rather than
# leaving the label to sit there meaning nothing until a human notices.
#
# A "deferred" entry — no own record yet, but `labelled_at` within the grace
# period — is *excluded* here too, the same as from
# `label_filter_own_applications`: it is not proven to be ours, so it is not
# safe to retry removing (#526's requirement 3 — deferred is a third state,
# not a synonym for "kept" that would otherwise fall into this set as a
# false stale-retry candidate). NOW defaults to `date -u`, same as that
# function, and the same caller passes the same `union_log_horizon` here too
# (#670) — not optional: this function and `label_filter_own_applications`
# share `_label_own_class_jq_def` precisely so they cannot disagree about a
# candidate's class, and passing the horizon to one but not the other would
# reintroduce exactly that disagreement.
#
# BLOCKED_JSON is `lib/cycle-state.sh`'s `blocked_items` extract, and the test
# against it is what separates a stuck label from a working one: while a block
# is open the label is not a leftover at all but requirement 34e's live
# projection of that block onto the issue, the one thing telling a human
# reading it that the pipeline is waiting on them. Every block counts, not
# only a refinement one — the same "any existing block disqualifies the issue"
# rule `refinement_hand_flag_new` applies to the entries this function does
# not take. Omitted, it defaults to "nothing is blocked"; the one caller that
# acts on the result passes the extract.
#
# Fails safe in the direction a write demands: malformed CANDIDATES_JSON, a
# malformed OWN_ACTIONS_JSON or a malformed BLOCKED_JSON yields nothing to
