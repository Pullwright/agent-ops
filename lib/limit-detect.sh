#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh, review-cycle.sh, monitor-cycle.sh,
# scripts/node-health.sh and scripts/publish-dashboard.sh so the phrase
# pattern, the reset-time parsing and the union's limit reduction live in
# exactly one place and the detectors can't drift apart again (see
# TD26071401). The union readers below fold UNION_STREAM_JQ's tolerant event
# stream, so this file sources lib/union-stream.sh itself, as
# lib/fleet-sizing.sh does: a test or script that sources this file alone
# still gets readers that work.
#
# Claude emits (at least) two distinct "you've hit a limit" messages, and they
# need different downstream handling:
#   - Weekly/rolling usage limit — "You've hit your weekly limit · resets Jul
#     17, 4am (Pacific/Auckland)". Carries a parseable reset time: stand down
#     until exactly then.
#   - Monthly spend cap — "You've hit your monthly spend limit · raise it at
#     claude.ai/settings/usage". Carries no reset time; clears only when a
#     human raises the cap (or the billing month rolls over) — auto-retry
#     cannot fix it.
# Both share the stem "You've hit your ... limit", so a single case-insensitive
# `hit your .* limit` term catches every observed variant, alongside the
# original terms this project has looked for from the start.

# The tolerant raw-line event stream the union readers fold (#2037).

# LIMIT_LONG_COOLDOWN_HOURS: fallback stand-down for a weekly/monthly limit
# whose reset time couldn't be parsed at all (e.g. the spend-cap message,
# which never states one). `limit_cooldown_default` (a few hours) is sized
# for a transient rate limit, not a weekly or monthly one — at that cadence it
# would waste a retry roughly every 3 hours for days.
#
# It is an *upper bound*, not a prediction — and since the probe of
# requirement 2.1b, not the exit either. Every limit clears on its own at the
# plan's rollover, and this system has no way to learn when that is when the
# message does not say; so while an estimated stand-down is in force, every
# cycle asks the API directly (see `limit_probe_verdict` and the 2.1b
# block in agent-cycle.sh) and retires the stand-down the moment the account
# answers. What this constant bounds is how long the *record* can outlive the
# limit when every probe comes back inconclusive — a node whose probes cannot
# reach the API at all is a node whose cycles could not have run anyway. What
# it must never do is present the guess as a deadline — see `reset_known`
# below.

# `reset_known` replaced an earlier `needs_human` flag, which claimed the

# a way that mattered: a hit limit has *two* exits — wait for the plan's
# rollover (no human involved) or raise the cap (a human, and only if they
# want it back sooner). Calling the first exit nonexistent turned an unknown
# reset time into an apparent dead end, and left the pipeline standing down on
# a fabricated deadline with no supported way to lift it. What the detector
# actually knows is narrower and is all this field now claims: whether the

# This is the better source wherever it exists, and worth saying why: the

# the model printed, and a sentence has to be pattern-matched, may not state a

# named zone that has to be resolved. `resetsAt` is an epoch. Where it is
# present the stand-down is a fact rather than an estimate, which is exactly
# the distinction `reset_known` was added to carry — and an estimated
# stand-down costs the fleet a probe every cycle until it clears.
#
# The class mapping follows what the fallback cooldown is for, not what the
# limit is called: a `seven_day*` limit is the long kind that
# `LIMIT_LONG_COOLDOWN_HOURS` exists for, and `five_hour` is not. It only

# `limit_union_fold(NAMES)` folds UNION_STREAM_JQ's `union_events` over the

#
#   record      the governing `limit-hit`, or null. Most-recent-wins over
#               *both* limit events, so a `limit-cleared` written after a
#               `limit-hit` supersedes it. Without that, an operator who
#               resolved the limit had no way to say so: the stand-down is
#               checked before any stage runs, so no cycle could ever succeed
#               and clear it from the inside.
#   since       the `ts` of the earliest `limit-hit` in the current
#               uninterrupted window — everything after the last
#               `limit-cleared` — or null. This is how long the fleet has been
#               frozen, as distinct from when the freeze was last *extended*
#               (the governing record's own `ts`), and is what the
#               automatic-freeze escalation ages against (requirement 2;
#               #244): a freeze that keeps re-confirming itself must not keep
#               resetting the clock that decides when a human hears about it.
#   escalated   the `since` of every `limit-freeze-escalated` event, the
#               escalation's once-per-freeze memory. There are few, so all are
#               kept.
#
# The stream is time-ordered by `fleet_logs`, which takes a damaged line apart
# before its sort, so each record the fold sees sits at its own timestamp's
# place. It is read as raw lines, each parsed on its own, never slurped: one
# line that does not parse made a slurp abort, so the reduction returned
# nothing and the fleet read "no limit in force" while one was (#2037). The
# stream also holds one record at a time, where the slurp held the whole
# union (#1649).
#
# A line that does not parse is skipped; a read that fails outright (jq
# killed, or its input unreadable) exits non-zero with jq's own error on
# stderr, so each caller can tell "no limit" from "could not read" and report
# the second (`guard_warn` in agent-cycle.sh, a `warning` event in the review
