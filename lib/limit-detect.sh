# Claude emits (at least) two distinct "you've hit a limit" messages, and they
# need different downstream handling:
#   - Weekly/rolling usage limit — "You've hit your weekly limit · resets Jul
#     17, 4am (Pacific/Auckland)". Carries a parseable reset time: stand down
#     until exactly then.
#   - Monthly spend cap — "You've hit your monthly spend limit · raise it at
#     claude.ai/settings/usage". Carries no reset time; clears only when a
#     human raises the cap (or the billing month rolls over) — auto-retry
#     cannot fix it.
# Both share the stem "You've hit your ... limit", so a single case-insensitive
# `hit your .* limit` term catches every observed variant, alongside the
# original terms this project has looked for from the start.

# Case-insensitive ERE fed to `grep -E`. This is the one place either script's
# limit-phrase pattern comes from — do not inline a copy elsewhere.

# LIMIT_LONG_COOLDOWN_HOURS: fallback stand-down for a weekly/monthly limit
# whose reset time couldn't be parsed at all (e.g. the spend-cap message,
# which never states one). `limit_cooldown_default` (a few hours) is sized
# for a transient rate limit, not a weekly or monthly one — at that cadence it
# would waste a retry roughly every 3 hours for days.
#
# It is an *upper bound*, not a prediction — and since the probe of
# requirement 2.1b, not the exit either. Every limit clears on its own at the
# plan's rollover, and this system has no way to learn when that is when the
# message does not say; so while an estimated stand-down is in force, every
# cycle asks the API directly (see `limit_probe_verdict` and the 2.1b
# block in agent-cycle.sh) and retires the stand-down the moment the account
# answers. What this constant bounds is how long the *record* can outlive the
# limit when every probe comes back inconclusive — a node whose probes cannot
# reach the API at all is a node whose cycles could not have run anyway. What
# it must never do is present the guess as a deadline — see `reset_known`
# below.

# `reset_known` replaced an earlier `needs_human` flag, which claimed the

# a way that mattered: a hit limit has *two* exits — wait for the plan's
# rollover (no human involved) or raise the cap (a human, and only if they
# want it back sooner). Calling the first exit nonexistent turned an unknown
# reset time into an apparent dead end, and left the pipeline standing down on
# a fabricated deadline with no supported way to lift it. What the detector
# actually knows is narrower and is all this field now claims: whether the

# the model printed, and a sentence has to be pattern-matched, may not state a

# named zone that has to be resolved. `resetsAt` is an epoch. Where it is
# present the stand-down is a fact rather than an estimate, which is exactly
# the distinction `reset_known` was added to carry — and an estimated
# stand-down costs the fleet a probe every cycle until it clears.
#
# The class mapping follows what the fallback cooldown is for, not what the
# limit is called: a `seven_day*` limit is the long kind that
# `LIMIT_LONG_COOLDOWN_HOURS` exists for, and `five_hour` is not. It only

# The usage-limit stand-down the fleet's event stream currently implies: print

#
# The reduction is most-recent-wins over *both* limit events, so a
# `limit-cleared` written after a `limit-hit` supersedes it. Without that, an
# operator who resolved the limit had no way to say so: the stand-down is
# checked before any stage runs, so no cycle could ever succeed and clear it
# from the inside. The stream is time-ordered by `fleet_logs`.
#
# One definition, because every stand-down reader needs it — agent-cycle.sh's
# stand-down, review-cycle.sh's two, the monitor's, `--status`,
# scripts/node-health.sh and the dashboard — and a reader that missed
# `limit-cleared` would keep standing its node down after the fleet resumed.
#
# Read as a stream of raw lines, each parsed on its own (`jq -nR` over
# `inputs | fromjson? // empty`, folded with `reduce`), never slurped. The
# union is every node's log concatenated, and one line that does not parse —
# a record cut off part-way and run into a whole later one, which the VM
# nodes' disk-pressure period left 33 of (#2037) — made a slurp abort, so
# this returned nothing and the fleet read "no limit in force" while one was.
# Plain `inputs` under `jq -n` aborts on the same line; only `-R` with a
# per-line `fromjson?` skips it. The stream also holds one record at a time,
# where the slurp held the whole union (#1649). `reduce` rather than
# `first`/`limit`: under jq 1.6 a `try` (which `fromjson?` is) swallows the
# `break` those are built on, so they would not stop at one.
#
# A line that does not parse is skipped; a read that fails outright (jq
# killed, or its input unreadable) exits non-zero with jq's own error on
# stderr, so each caller can tell "no limit" from "could not read" and report
# the second (`guard_warn` in agent-cycle.sh) rather than act on it silently.
