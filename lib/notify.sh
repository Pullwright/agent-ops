# lib/notify.sh — the installation's one push-notification channel
# (issue #1279, requirement 2m as rewritten): every escalation issue filed or
# auto-closed, every `pager-fired`/`pager-cleared` (#1278), and every
# fleet-wide stand-down beginning or ending, POSTed as one compact JSON body
# to `notify_webhook_url`. Promoted from `escalation_webhook_notify`'s own
# narrower job — a filing-failure fallback only — which is now the
# `escalation-unfiled` event class alongside the others.
#
# `notify_webhook_url`'s own value is a credential — possession of the URL is
# authorisation to post to it — so it also has a non-public, per-node source:
# the `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable, read by each caller and
# resolved ahead of both config.json keys by `notify_resolve_webhook_url`
# below (issue #991, TD-PPagop-26082516). config.json's own `notify_webhook_url`
# stays the fleet-wide, tracked-file default for an installation that accepts
# that trade-off; the environment source is what lets one that does not
# leave it empty there.
#
# Deliberately self-contained, the same reasoning lib/pager.sh's own header
# gives for not depending on lib/enabler.sh: `notify_post` is called from
# inside an active agent-cycle.sh process (cycle-scoped globals available:
# `log_file`, `node_name`, `cycle_id`) and from scripts/publish-dashboard.sh's
# Publisher tick (no cycle, no per-item context) alike. Every context
# `notify_post` needs is therefore an explicit parameter, never a global this
# file reads directly — `notify_post_cycle` below is the one place that
# bridges the two, reading the cycle's own globals once and forwarding them
# positionally, exactly the shape `escalation_webhook_notify` used to be.
#
# Event-sourced, like every other dedup/retry state this codebase keeps: no
# state file of its own. `notify-sent`/`notify-suppressed`/`notify-failed`
# land in the ordinary log.jsonl, and `notify_min_interval_seconds`'s
# per-(event, key) coalescing is a read over that log (READ_LOG, ordinarily
# `${union_log:-$log_file}` — fleet-wide where a union exists, so two nodes
# racing the same key still coalesce; per node where one does not yet, see
# notify_post_cycle below), not a cache.

# notify_resolve_webhook_url NOTIFY_URL ESCALATION_URL [ENV_URL]
# ENV_URL — the `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable (issue #991,
# TD-PPagop-26082516) — wins whenever it is set, so an installation can keep
# the secret out of config.json, which is fleet-wide and tracked in this
# public repository, entirely. Otherwise `notify_webhook_url` wins when set;
# `escalation_webhook_url` is accepted as an alias for one release (issue
# #1279) when `notify_webhook_url` is empty. Prints the resolved URL, or
# nothing. The caller is responsible for validating ENV_URL first
# (`notify_webhook_url_env_or_empty` below) — this function trusts whatever
