# visibility for the Co-Ordinator's own exclusion (issue #175) instead of a

# already age-filtered to `claim_ttl_hours` — the only source for a file claim,
# since the four finishing sources have no branch — and `lib/claim.sh
# branches`, a live scan that still catches a claim the registry missed
# (`state_repo` unset, or a failed best-effort write). By the time this runs,
# step 2.1a's claim GC has already swept anything past the TTL, so a live
# branch found here is either still fresh or has real work pushed to it, and
# either way belongs in the list — no separate TTL check is needed for it.

# A branch-derived item is recovered by stripping `td/` or `branch_prefix`

#
# A refinement entry is small — `ts`, `cycle`, and either a `comment_url` or a
# `spec`. The `spec` is not: it is a whole work order in markdown, several
# kilobytes of it, written for an item type with no thread to hold it
# (tech-debt, a review recommendation, a plan task). The map is a ledger, never
# retired, so every spec the Refiner has ever written is still in it — on
# 2026-08-21 that was 24 specs totalling 219,175 bytes, of which 22 (203,645
# bytes) belonged to items no band of this cycle still names as a candidate.
# That is what took the assembled prompt past the model's window and had the
# API refuse the stage on every node of the fleet, eleven consecutive cycles,
# with no work selected anywhere while it lasted.
#
# The prompt's "Items that have been refined" gives the spec exactly one use:
# an item the Co-Ordinator is about to put in a work order must have its spec
# pasted verbatim into `context`, because it exists nowhere else. That use is
# reachable only for an item that is a candidate this cycle. So the spec of an
# item no band offers is bytes the Co-Ordinator is told to read and can never
# act on, and dropping it removes no judgement — the same test
# `coordinator_blocked_view` is trimmed against.
#
# What is *not* dropped is the entry: `ts`, `cycle` and `comment_url` stay for
# every item, refined or not, because "Look the item up here before you decide
# it is under-specified" and the `refinement_policy` gate both read the entry's
# presence rather than its spec, and a `comment_url` is a pointer whose cost is
# a line. Only the payload with a single, candidate-scoped use is shed.
#
# A spec sitting *beside* a `comment_url` is shed whatever its candidacy
# (agent-ops#1128). `refinement_record_fields` no longer writes that pair, but
# the ledger is never retired, so entries recorded before it stopped are still
# read here for as long as their items live — and for those the pointer already
# resolves to the same text the payload holds. This is the read side of the
# same "one home per refinement" rule, and it is what lets a ledger written
# under the old rule stop being charged for twice.
#
# Both documents arrive on stdin, never in argv (requirement 4g): this map is
# the value that crossed MAX_ARG_STRLEN, and an `--argjson` here would trade
# the refusal this function exists to prevent for the execve death that
# requirement exists to prevent.
#
# Every degradation is toward the *untrimmed* ledger, never toward a smaller
# one — the same direction `coordinator_blocked_view` and requirement 4i's own
# guards take. Note which way that points for each document: a `repos` array
# that will not parse, or is not an array, means candidacy cannot be decided at
# all, so nothing may be shed on the strength of it. Coercing it to `[]` would
# read as "no candidates" and strip every spec in the fleet — an un-refinement
# of every item at once, dressed as a successful trim, and a far worse failure
# than the overflow this function exists to prevent. An empty array is a
# different fact and is honoured: a cycle really can offer no candidates, and
# then no spec has a use.

# anything the candidate itself claims — and confirm it is genuinely
# present, verbatim, in the candidate's own `context` or `acceptance`. A
# `spec` entry costs nothing to check (it is already in hand); a
# `comment_url` entry costs one `gh api` read of the actual comment, because
# the pre-fetched `comments` array a repo's `issues` entry carries has no
# per-comment id to join it back against. A `comment_url` whose own embedded
# issue number disagrees with `item` is a fault before any fetch is
# attempted — the one case cheap enough to catch even a corrupted ledger
# entry, not only a model that ignored a correct one. A network failure
# fetching the real comment is a fault (`untraceable`), not the fail-open
# direction every other degraded `gh` read in this pipeline takes
# (TD-PPagop-26082307): this is the one check that exists specifically to
# confirm a refinement is present, so a read it cannot complete cannot be
# read as a pass — see the comment at that fetch below.

# rejoining with a single space. A model's paste of a multi-kilobyte spec or
# issue thread drifts in exactly these ways (a reflowed line, a normalized
# list marker, a trimmed trailing space) without changing what it says, and a
# verbatim `contains` trips on every one of them; this tolerates all of them
# while still failing a passage that is genuinely missing or different. Prints
# to stdout; a jq failure (should not happen — input is always a shell
# string) degrades to the input unchanged rather than losing the text.

# Requirement 17f, repair half (issue #767).
#
# `refinement_traceability_fault` above asks whether the *model* copied the
# refinement across. That question was never the requirement: 17b/20 ask that
# the work order **carry** the item's refinement, and the Script is holding
# the text while it asks. Between 2026-08-22T23:42Z (when the check landed)
# and 2026-08-24T10:00Z it discarded 92 candidates across 20 issues and
# admitted none — a gate with no observed passes is not a gate, it is an
# outage — while `coordinator_model` was `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` and the
# band feeding it was being trimmed to fit that model's window. Text trimmed
# out of the input cannot be pasted back out of it, so the check was asking
# for something the cycle had already made impossible.
#
# So: supply what is missing instead of discarding the work. This function
# returns the candidate with the recorded refinement appended verbatim to
# `context`, which makes traceability true **by construction** rather than
# by inspection — a stronger guarantee than the check it replaces, and one
# no model can fail.
#
# What it deliberately does not repair:
#
#   * A `comment_url` whose own embedded issue number disagrees with `item`.
#     That is a corrupt ledger entry, not a copying failure, and appending
#     another issue's comment to this item's order is exactly the #626 defect
#     the gate exists to prevent. `refinement_traceability_fault` still
#     reports it and the caller still skips — repair is offered only for the
#     missing-text faults.
#   * A refinement it cannot read. A failed `gh` fetch leaves the candidate
#     untouched and the caller's own fault check decides, so this fails in
#     the same direction the check already does.

# Prints the repaired candidate JSON, or nothing when there is nothing to

#
# 17g reads every backtick span in `acceptance` as a quotation of the item.
# Backticks in Markdown do not mean that: they mean code, and a work order
# uses them to name the file it will create, the glob it will walk, the
# template an id follows. Those are the order's own output, not claims about
# the item's text, so their absence from the item says nothing — and on
# 2026-08-31 it said "fabricated" eight times out of eight, with the fleet
# selecting nothing while it did.
#
# Two shapes are exempted, both because a match is impossible rather than
# merely unlikely — which is what keeps this a narrowing of the check and not
# a weakening of it:
#
#   - a *pattern*: a span carrying `*`, `?`, or `<…>`. A glob generalises the
#     strings it stands for, so it cannot appear verbatim in the prose it
#     generalises; `scripts/gather-*` is refused precisely because the item
#     names `scripts/gather-human-visibility-hygiene` instead.
#   - a *path*: a span with a directory separator whose last segment carries
#     an extension. `lib/gh-shim.sh` is the file the work order creates, so it
#     is absent from the item by definition — and absent from the repository
#     too, until the order it belongs to is implemented.
#
# Everything else stays checked, and that deliberately includes the bare
# identifier: both fabrications on record — `_verify_stage_claims` (#815) and
# `refinement_policy_matrix` (#821) — are bare `snake_case` identifiers, so an
# exemption shaped to let those through would disarm the requirement
# altogether. It also means a real identifier the item happens not to spell
# (`merge_conflicts`, a `sourceToken` from this repo's own schema) still
# faults: shape cannot separate an invented identifier from an inferred one,

# Requirement 17g (issue #821): a work order's `acceptance` can name a

# actually read, presenting invention as the item's own. The #815 incident
# (cycle 20260826T064910Z-poetic-1-186841): a Co-Ordinator whose input had
# been trimmed to fit its model's window invented an `acceptance` in full,
# and requirement 17f's own repair (which only ever asks "is the *recorded
# refinement* present", never "is everything else here real") logged the
# result a success. Scoped to a candidate whose `{repo, item}` appears in
# `coordinator_fit_trimmed_items`'s own output this cycle — an untrimmed
# entry carries nothing elided to fabricate about, so this costs nothing
# there, the same "nothing to check, no `gh` call" shape
# `refinement_traceability_fault` already uses for an item with no recorded
# refinement.
#
# `context` is not checked here (agent-ops#830's owner decision on #821, PR
# #825): `prompts/coordinator.md`'s work-order schema requires `context` to
# carry the Co-Ordinator's own framing — file paths, related conventions
# found while evaluating, why the item is unblocked and in scope — alongside
# the entry's verbatim paste, and nothing in the schema marks where the
# paste ends and the framing begins. A check that faulted every paragraph it
# could not trace therefore faulted that mandated framing by construction,
# on ordinary honest work orders, at the fit rungs the fleet normally runs
# at — reproduced by two independent Reviewer rounds against this PR's own
# work order. TD-PPagop-26082801 tracks that deferred detection gap against
# #769, the issue asking whether the Co-Ordinator should be pasting
# `context` at all — the schema question a narrower check would need first.
#
# `acceptance`, by contrast, is explicitly allowed to be the Co-Ordinator's
# own synthesis ("set acceptance from the current state of the thread") — a
# faithful paraphrase is traceable and must not fault, which is deliberately
# weaker than requiring an appropriate-tier model to have authored it (that
# question belongs to agent-ops#822, out of scope here). So only its own
# backtick-quoted spans (`` `like this` ``) — the concrete specifics (a
# file, a flag, an identifier) a paraphrase preserves from its source and a
# fabrication is what actually invents — are checked, once normalized (the
# same whitespace collapse `_traceability_normalize` already applies for
# requirement 17f), against the union of the live text (fetched fresh,
# above) and the item's own recorded refinement `spec` (already legitimate:
# whether it belongs in the order at all is requirement 17f's own question,
# not this one's); free prose around them is never compared.
#
# Prints a non-empty fault naming the invented span; prints nothing when
# there is nothing to check (not trimmed this cycle, or `acceptance` carries
# no backtick span) or every span checks out. A `gh` read that fails is a
# fault — TD-PPagop-26082307's reasoning applies unchanged: this check
# exists to confirm the live text really is what backs the work order, and
# assuming pass on a read it could not complete would let a stale token or a
# narrowed scope disarm the whole gate while it kept reading as green —
# reported via `guard_warn`, never swallowed. Never exits non-zero.
#
# Unlike a missing refinement, a fault this function reports is never
# repaired: appending the real text alongside a false one does not make the
# false one true, so a candidate that faults here is always a hard skip,
# logged with its own `cause: "fabricated"` — never folded into
# `cause: "untraceable"`, so a reader of the log or the dashboard never has to
# guess whether a skip was a copying failure or an invention.

# Requirement 17h (agent-ops#769): composes `context`/`acceptance`/`title` for
# the one candidate the Co-Ordinator (or the fallback, requirement 3v) has
# already selected, so neither ever authors those three fields for a
# pre-fetched source — the model's own job narrows to selection (and to
# `model`/`model_reason`, a judgement call this does not touch). Scoped to
# the eleven sources the Script already gathers as structured data
# (`CANDIDATE_ENTRY_LOOKUP_JQ` above); the three sources the Co-Ordinator
# still derives itself live — `project-review`, `failed-runs`,
# `implementation-plan` — have no pre-fetched band for the Script to compose
# from and were never subject to the fit ladder's own trimming (the problem
# agent-ops#769 exists to close), so this prints nothing and returns 2 for
# them: the caller keeps the model's own `context`/`acceptance` unchanged,
# exactly as before this requirement existed.
#
# For `issues`/`tech-debt` — the only two bands the fit ladder ever trims
# (lib/coordinator-input.sh) — the entry found is refreshed with a live fetch
# (`item_live_entry` above) before templating, unconditionally, whether or
# not this cycle actually trimmed it: a work order's `context` must never
# depend on the band entry's freshness at all, not merely recover when it was
# visibly short this cycle. For the other seven sources, the pre-fetched
# entry is used directly — `lib/coordinator-input.sh`'s own header confirms
# the fit ladder never touches these, so there is nothing for a live fetch to
# correct.
#
# Once composed, `refinement_traceability_repair` (agent-ops#767) is called
# unconditionally — never gated behind a fault check, since there is no
# model-authored text left to fault — so a recorded refinement is always
# spliced onto the freshly composed `context`, generalising that repair from
# "rescue a candidate the model got wrong" to "the one way a refinement ever
# reaches a Script-composed work order."
#

# `item`, `model`, `model_reason`, and any per-source `branch`/`pr_url`/
# `pr_number`/`base`/`takeover` — is carried over unchanged). Exit 1: the
# entry could not be found in `ordered_repos_json`, or the live fetch failed
# — a fail-closed compose failure the caller must treat as a hard skip, never
# a fallback to the trimmed band entry (requirement 17f's own "untraceable"
# cause already names exactly this: a construction-time check refusing to

# Requirement 3u/issue #320: the same deterministic-code-not-model-judgement
# exclusion as exclude_blocked_or_void_items above, purpose-built for the one
# pre-fetched band that function cannot be reused for as-is. Requirement 3t
# left `issues` out of the blanket exclusion on purpose — requirement 18a
# obliges the Co-Ordinator to re-read a blocked issue's live thread when its
# `updated_at` carries evidence posted after the block was last confirmed
# current, and a candidate dropped before the Co-Ordinator ever saw it cannot
# be re-read. Dropping every blocked issue here, the way `tech_debt` and every
# other band now are (see the loop below), would silently retire that
# mandatory re-check — precisely the live judgement 18a exists to keep in
# front of a human-in-the-loop model, not remove it.
#
# So this drops only what the prompt's own "Re-checking blocked items" and "A
# blocked issue with fresh evidence must be re-read" sections already tell the
# Co-Ordinator to skip *without* a re-read: an issue whose `updated_at` is no
# newer than the later of the block's own `ts` and its newest
# `recheck_clean_ts` (requirement 18a's own threshold, mirrored verbatim —
# `test/cycle-state.test.sh`'s `needs_mandatory_reread` pins the same
# comparison against the same field). That is exactly the "skip it on the
# marker alone, no re-read needed" case the prompt already states is
# mechanical, so removing it from the Co-Ordinator's judgement removes no
# judgement at all. A blocked issue whose `updated_at` *is* newer survives
# this filter and reaches the Co-Ordinator exactly as before, for the live
# re-read only it can perform. Void issues are dropped unconditionally, like
# every other band: unlike a block, a void has no re-check to preserve
# (requirement 34c — only a human's `unvoided` ever reopens one).
#
# Malformed input degrades to passing the array through unfiltered, and a
# candidate missing `ref` is dropped rather than crashed on — the same
# fail-open terms as exclude_blocked_or_void_items. Both extracts arrive on

# Requirement 3x's machine corroboration (issue #322) — requirement 3t's own

# cycle's eligible items (ELIGIBLE_JSON, `{repo, item, source}` entries,
# `coordinator_eligible_items`' own output across every pre-fetched band) a
# `selected: false` verdict left completely unaccounted for. A bar-clearing
# item may be declined without being selected only two ways: reported in
# `needs_refinement` under that item's own source, or voided this same cycle —
# the same two the prompt's own "Reporting an under-specified item" and "Void
# items" sections give every source. `refinement_policy[<source>] ==
# "required"` is a third, legitimate silent skip (requirement 39a: an
# unrefined item there is never selectable, so the Co-Ordinator owes it no
# report), which is why an eligible entry from such a source is dropped here
# rather than flagged as unaccounted.
#
# The band is carried on the entry rather than passed as an argument, so one
# call corroborates the whole verdict at once and the per-source policy, the
# per-source `needs_refinement` match and the per-band tally all fall out of
# the same pass. That is deliberately not six copies of one rule: the *only*
# thing that varies by band is which items are eligible, and that is
# `coordinator_eligible_items`' job, not this one's.
#
# RECORDED_JSON is what the Script *recorded* from the Co-Ordinator's message
# — `log_needs_refinement_items`' and `log_voided_items`' own collections —
# never the message's `needs_refinement`/`voided` arrays verbatim, and that
# property is preserved band by band rather than re-argued per band. The
# difference is the whole point: `record_needs_refinement_block` drops an
# entry that fails requirement 34d's five-field bar with nothing but a
# warning, so a claimed-but-dropped report leaves its item open, unclaimed
# and eligible — and had it still counted as accounting for that item, the
# corroboration would have been satisfied, the fingerprint armed, and the
# next cycle's byte-identical inputs would have stood the fleet down on a
# verdict that never engaged with the band: issue #310's freeze, reopened
# through a narrow door (every eligible item reported, every report
# malformed — precisely the fields a small model omits). A `voided` entry, by
# contrast, is counted whichever way the void guard rules, because both
# outcomes are recorded state: a pass writes the void, a refusal writes a
# block (requirement 34d), and either removes the item from the next cycle's
# eligible set — so the two arrays are hardened by the one rule "count what
# was recorded", not by two different shape tests.
#
# Any entry this prints is evidence the Co-Ordinator's verdict did not
# actually engage with the band it is declining — exactly the shape of the
# incident this requirement exists for (issue #310), where the stated reason
# ("requires per-item evaluation…", "heavily voided or blocked") was
# demonstrably false against data the Script itself had already filtered.
# Malformed input degrades to `[]` — silence, not a false positive — on the
# same fail-open terms as exclude_claimed_items and
# exclude_blocked_or_void_items above.

# Requirement 3x (issue #322): the Script's own answer to "what could the
# Co-Ordinator actually have selected this cycle", across every band it hands
# over pre-fetched — `{repo, item, source}` per entry, `source` the same token
# the repo's `sources` list, a `needs_refinement` entry and
# `refinement_policy` all use. It is the denominator `unaccounted_items`
# above tests a `selected: false` verdict against, and the reason that
# function needs no per-band special-casing of its own.
#
# Read *after* requirement 2.2a's back-pressure decision, for the reason
# requirement 3t's tech-debt-only predecessor was: a restricted cycle narrows
# every repo's `sources` to the four finishing ones, and a verdict is owed no
# account of a band this cycle forbade it to select from. Which is also why
# each band is gated on the repo's own `sources` here rather than on the array
# merely being non-empty: back-pressure narrows the list without emptying
# `findings`, `register_hygiene` or `human_visibility`, so the list is the
# authority on what was selectable and the array is not.
#
# Three bands need more than "every entry in the array":
#
#   - `issues` is one source at four ranks (requirement 15e), so an issue is
#     eligible only if its own `Priority` band's token is listed — a repo
#     configured `issues:high` alone was never offered its Medium issues.
#   - `issues` also still carries blocked entries after requirement 3u's own
#     pass: `exclude_blocked_or_void_issues` deliberately keeps the ones whose
#     thread has moved, because requirement 18a obliges a live re-read only the
#     Co-Ordinator can perform. A blocked issue is not selectable until that
#     re-read unblocks it, so counting it here would demand an account for an
#     item the Script did not offer. They are dropped on exactly
#     `exclude_blocked_or_void_items`' matching rule, blank `repo` included.
#   - `merge_conflicts` carries the one entry shape the prompt tells the
#     Co-Ordinator to skip in silence: a Dependabot PR this system has not yet
#     asked to rebase (`bot`, no `rebase_requested`, not superseded) is "not a
#     candidate of any kind" there, so it is not one here either. Its
#     superseded sibling *is* eligible — the prompt requires that one in
#     `voided`, which is an account.
#
# Every other band is exactly "an entry's presence in this array is the
# candidate test", which is the prompt's own words for all six of them. A jq
# failure yields `[]` — no corroboration rather than a false one — on the same
# fail-open terms as every exclusion above.

# --- The refinement class (requirements 16a, 34e) ---------------------------
# An item nobody has specified well enough to work on is blocked by that fact,
# and the Co-Ordinator is the actor that discovers it — while walking candidates
# it was going to walk anyway. It reports; the Script records. That division is
# requirement 36's, and it is what makes the record real: an issue or a label the
# Script did not write is one no later cycle can match against its own log.
#
# The label is a projection of the block onto the one item type that can carry
# one, and it is applied *before* the event is written so the event can record
# whether it took. A label recorded on the block is a label a later cycle knows
# to remove; a label assumed from config is one it might try to remove from an
# issue that never had it, or leave on an issue after the key changed.

# release_refinement_label ITEM [REPO]
# Take the projected labels — `needs_refinement_label`, and `blocked`/
# `blocked:<reason>` (requirement 38b, agent-ops#639) — off the issue behind
# ITEM, if this item's refinement block put them there. Called wherever a
# block clears — the Co-Ordinator's own re-check, an Enabler `unblocked`, and
# a `void` from either — because all three labels' lifecycles mirror the
# block's. A removal that fails here is retried later, not by anything else:
# `needs_refinement_label` by requirement 39f's stale-retry,
# `blocked`/`blocked:<reason>` by the reconciliation sweep beside it
# (agent-ops#651).
#
# Reads the blocked extract this cycle computed *before* the Co-Ordinator ran,
# which is the correct one: the block being cleared is by definition one that was
# open when the cycle started. Best-effort throughout — a stale label is a
# cosmetic fault on an issue, and no reason to disturb a cycle recording state.

# record_needs_refinement_block ENTRY STAGE
# Record one needs_refinement-shaped ENTRY (`{repo, item, source, reason,
# missing, evidence}`) as a block attributed to STAGE (requirement 34e).
# Returns 1 and records nothing but a `warning` when ENTRY fails requirement
# 34d's completeness bar, the item is already blocked, or it re-asserts a
# `Blocked-by:` dependency this cycle's own gate already resolved.
#
# The single recorder for every stage that can report this class of block —
# the Co-Ordinator (requirement 16a), the Implementer's escape hatch
# (requirement 9f), and the Refiner's own decline (requirement 39d). One
# definition (requirement 34a): three reporters, one recorder, so the labels
# and the block's shape can never drift between them.
#
# Three entries are dropped rather than recorded, each with a warning, and all
# three refusals are the Script's job rather than the reporting stage's:
#
#   - a malformed entry, on requirement 34d's discipline. The fields are what the
#     Enabler starts from; an entry without them starves the very stage this
#     path exists to reach.
#   - a re-report of an item that is *already* blocked. Requirement 34 keys a
#     block on repo+item and requirement 35a measures the Enabler threshold from
#     the latest one, so re-reporting the same item every cycle would push that
#     clock forward cycle after cycle and the item would never become eligible —
#     the same silent starvation this whole path exists to end, with an event
#     trail that looks like progress.
#   - a `source: "issues"` entry whose own `reason`/`missing`/`evidence` names,
#     by number, the same `Blocked-by:` dependency this cycle's
#     `issues_by_repo_json` already proves resolved for that item's thread
#     (`dependency_refusal_reason`, lib/dependency-gate.sh; issue #566).
#     Requirement 16's dependency exclusion is deterministic and applied by the
#     Script before any candidate reaches a reporting stage — re-asserting it
#     from a thread's own stale prose is never a legitimate reason to decline an
#     item, and recording one as a block would silently blind selection to an
#     item the gate already cleared.
#   - a Co-Ordinator report naming an item this same cycle's fit ladder
#     actually trimmed (`coordinator_fit_trim_refusal_reason`,
#     lib/coordinator-input.sh; requirement 4i; agent-ops#683), logged as a
#     warning naming the item and the rung. A trimmed candidate's body can be
#     as little as a title-level fragment, and "if you cannot tell what done
#     would mean, report needs_refinement" then compels a report the
#     completeness bar (requirement 3x) would otherwise force the Script to
#     record as a block — nine items, most of them already refined, flagged
#     `needs-refinement` in 68 seconds on 2026-08-21 (and, before
#     agent-ops#651 ended that separate path, re-assigned too), on a cycle
#     whose Co-Ordinator did nothing wrong. Scoped to `stage == "coordinator"`:
#     the Refiner and Implementer read the repository live rather than off
#     this cycle's Co-Ordinator input, so a fit-ladder mark on that input says
#     nothing about what either of them actually had in front of them.

# void is terminal and worth recording precisely; an entry naming no item is
# ignored.
#
# Requirement 34d: it is corroborated before it is made permanent. The
# Co-Ordinator is the one void author that never reads the tree — it sees a JSON
# digest of candidates and nothing else — so an assertion it makes about the
# default branch is checked against the facts the same cycle gathered, against
# a resolvable `evidence` citation fetched from the repository itself, and
# against requirement 34c's long-standing demand for evidence being present at
# all. An entry the guard refuses is recorded `blocked` instead: the
# Co-Ordinator still skips the item, so nothing churns, but the record is
# clearable and Enabler-eligible (requirement 35a), so an actor that can read
# the tree gets to adjudicate rather than the item disappearing on an unchecked
# claim. See lib/void-guard.sh for what the guard tests and why it is not a
# prompt instruction.

# Collects every entry it disposed of into `coord_recorded_voided_json` for

# a block, and either takes the item out of the next cycle's eligible set. An
# entry naming no item is the one thing that records nothing, and it is the
# one thing not collected.
#
# `flags_json` is read once, here, rather than once per entry inside the
# loop below (issue #508): within one invocation the union log is a snapshot
# already fixed before this function runs, so `draft_obsolete_flags` gives
# the same answer on entry ten as it did on entry one — recomputing it per
# entry paid two full log scans for a result that never changed. It is
