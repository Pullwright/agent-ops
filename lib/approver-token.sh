# lib/approver-token.sh — GitHub App installation-token minting for the
# Pullwright Approver (D18 WI-4, agent-ops#407; design:
# docs/reviews/2026-08-14-autonomy-investigation.md §5.3).
#
# The Approver acts as a GitHub App identity ("Pullwright Approver",
# agent-ops#406), not the owner's PAT: an App-submitted review is what makes
# `required_approving_review_count: 1` load-bearing without recreating
# self-approval. This file is a thin wrapper over lib/github-app-token.sh's
# shared minting mechanics — the three-step dance (sign a JWT, exchange it
# for an installation token, cache the result), its fail-closed contract, and
# its tmpfs-only cache guarantee are all specified there, not repeated here.
# agent-ops#607 (Phase 2) pulled that machinery out of this file into the
# shared one once a second identity (the forge authoring App,
# lib/author-token.sh) needed the identical dance against a different
# App/installation/key; every function below now does nothing but supply
# this identity's own environment variable names and delegate.
#
# Four environment variables carry the App's identity, deliberately not
# committed anywhere and not read from config.json (the same discipline
# GH_TOKEN already follows — deploy/docker/.env.example, "GitHub"):
#
#   PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_APP_ID              the App's numeric id
#   PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_ID     the default installation's numeric id
#   PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_IDS    per-owner installation ids (JSON map)
#   PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH    path to the App's .pem private key
#
# The key is read from a path, never from its own environment variable: an
# RSA private key is multi-line and openssl's `-sign` flag already wants a
# file, so a path is the one shape that needs no on-disk materialisation step
# of its own. The file must exist wherever this runs — bind-mounted read-only,
# `chmod 600`, kept out of every repository, exactly as agent-ops#406's own
# comment describes.
#
# One App, several installations (agent-ops#913): a GitHub App installation
# is per account, so once `repos[]` spans two owners — e.g. `agent-ops` on
# `Pullwright` while `poetic`/`poetic-fiddle`/`agent-ops-state` stay on
# `Poetic-Poems` — one installation id can no longer back every repository
# this identity reviews. `PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_IDS` is a JSON
# object mapping owner to installation id (`{"Pullwright": 12345678,
# "Poetic-Poems": 87654321}`); every function below that mints or reads
# against a specific installation takes the repository slug (or bare owner)
# it is acting for and resolves the installation id by the owner half,
# case-insensitively, from that map, falling back to
# `PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_ID` for an owner the map does not name.
# A single-owner fleet sets only the scalar `PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_ID`,
# exactly as before, and never needs the map at all.
#
# Rejected: deriving the installation from `GET /app/installations` with the
# App JWT. The installation id is an operator *declaration* of where the
# Approver may act — the same reason `approver_app_id` is declared in
# config.json and reconciled by doctor rather than looked up — and a lookup
# would let an installation added on any account silently widen the fleet's
# reach.
#
# `approver_token_identity_login` is the one function here that needs no
# installation id to resolve: an App's own login (`GET /app`) is identical
# across every installation of the same App, so it takes no slug and simply
# asks for *some* configured installation (default or, absent that, any one
# entry of the map) to satisfy the shared credential-present gate.
#
# The App id, unlike the key, is not a secret — it already exists in
# config.json as `approver_app_id`, the operator's declaration doctor
# validates for any merge_autonomy level above `human` (requirement 2.3b).
# The environment stays what this file reads (it is the wiring compose/.env
# will carry), but the two are not independent: `scripts/doctor.sh`
# reconciles them, failing a set `PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_APP_ID` that differs
# from a set `approver_app_id`, so the App the operator declared and the App
# this file mints against cannot drift apart silently.
#
# No fallback to any other credential anywhere in this file: it references
# no identity but the Approver's own, so an absent App key can never silently
# reroute an approve/land call through the owner's own token, which would
# recreate the self-approval the App exists to retire.
#
# Sourced, never executed: it sets no shell options, so a caller's own
# `set -euo pipefail` (agent-cycle.sh) or `set -uo pipefail` decides.
#
# Environment overrides, for tests only: APPROVER_TOKEN_CURL, APPROVER_TOKEN_OPENSSL
# (stub binaries) and APPROVER_TOKEN_CACHE_DIR (an alternative tmpfs — a
# non-tmpfs directory is refused, so the override cannot re-introduce disk,
# and so is one that is not private to this user).

# _approver_token_installation_id_valid ID
# True (exit 0) iff ID is a syntactically usable installation id: a non-empty
# run of digits, which is what GitHub issues and the only thing any consumer
# of this file can do anything with. Everything below routes both the map and
# the scalar through here, so a configuration typo can never be *carried* —
# only fallen back from, or reported as gate-unreadable.
#
# Three separate things break on an id that reaches a consumer unchecked, and
# only the first is obvious. A non-numeric id 404s at
# POST /app/installations/<id>/access_tokens, which reads in a log as "GitHub
# did not issue a token" rather than as the config typo it is. It also
# defeats github-app-token.sh's cache-key invariant, whose
# `_github_app_token_cache_file` collapses every [^0-9A-Za-z_-] to `_`, so two
# distinct malformed ids can collide on one cache file. And an id of `*` or
# `@` is a bash hazard in its own right: `scripts/doctor.sh` indexes
# associative arrays by installation id (`${ait_perm_verdict[$ait_id]:-}`),
# where either subscript expands as *all elements* rather than as a lookup.

# approver_token_installation_id_for SLUG_OR_OWNER
# Resolve the Approver installation id for a repository slug ("owner/repo")
# or a bare owner, by the owner half, case-insensitively, against
# PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_IDS (a JSON object of owner to
# installation id), falling back to PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_ID for
# an owner the map does not name. Prints the resolved id and returns 0, or
# prints nothing and returns 1 if neither names this owner.
#
# An empty SLUG_OR_OWNER returns 1 rather than falling back to the scalar.
# It names no owner, so it can only arrive as a caller error — the shape
# every call site here had before agent-ops#913 gave them all a slug — and
# the fleet-wide default is precisely the wrong answer to it: in a
# multi-owner fleet it mints against one owner's installation for a
# repository belonging to another, and the resulting 403/404 surfaces at
# write time as "GitHub did not issue" rather than as the gate-unreadable
# this file reports for every other unresolvable credential. Callers that
# genuinely have no owner in play ask approver_token_any_installation_id.
#
# A map that is set but not valid JSON, or not a JSON object, is treated the
# same as an empty map (falls straight through to the scalar default) rather
# than raised as an error here — malformed configuration is exactly what
# scripts/doctor.sh exists to catch before this ever runs against it, and a
# minting path failing closed on a config typo would turn a doctor `fail`
# into a mint failure with a much less specific diagnosis. A malformed
# *value* under a well-formed map key falls through the same way, and for the
# same reason: `null`, an object or an array stringifies to a non-empty token
# that would otherwise shadow a perfectly good scalar default, turning a
# fallback into a permanent mint failure for that one owner.
