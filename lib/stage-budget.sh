# lib/stage-budget.sh — how long a stage is allowed (requirement 4f of
# docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md).
#
# Requirement 4e gave every stage two caps: a backstop and a liveness
# watchdog. This file decides what those two numbers should be, per
# (actor, repository, model), from the pipeline's own record of itself —
# because a number chosen by hand is a guess that decays. The cost of
# reviewing this repository rises with every specification edit, so whatever
# figure is picked becomes wrong on the same trajectory that made the last one
# wrong; and for an installation that is not this one, nobody should be asked
# to pick at all.
#
# Nothing here is stored. Every value is a pure function of the fleet log
# union, recomputed at the top of each cycle — the same way the blocked
# extract, the void extract and the no-op fingerprint are derived rather than
# kept. That is not a shortcut: a stored controller state is a second thing to
# replicate, to reconcile between four nodes, and to be wrong. A fold over the
# events every node already shares gives every node the same answer with
# nothing to synchronise.
#
# The two numbers are estimated quite differently, and that is the point.
#
#   the watchdog threshold is ESTIMATED, from a statistic that converges fast.
#     Its sample is inter-event gaps (requirement 33a), so one long stage
#     contributes an observation of the thing being measured rather than one
#     data point about a whole run. A new repository has a usable gap
#     distribution within a few cycles, not weeks.
#
#   the backstop is CONTROLLED, not estimated, so it needs no data at all to
#     start. Run durations give exactly one observation per stage per cycle,
#     and — worse — a killed run enters the sample at its cap rather than at
#     its true length, so fitting a cap to them drags the estimate down, which
#     lowers the cap, which censors more runs. Simulated over the real
#     distributions that spiral does not converge; it wanders and never
#     recovers the tail. So the backstop is not fitted. It starts generous and
#     moves only in response to kills that actually happened.
#
# Both directions of both mechanisms are chosen so that censoring pushes them
# the safe way. See `stage_budget_table`.

# The shipped priors, in minutes, and the only numbers here that are not
# derived from something. They exist so that an installation with no history
# whatever — a customer on its first cycle — gets sensible behaviour without
# being asked to choose anything.
#
# Every one sits above the fixed cap it replaces, because a backstop equal to
# that cap is not a backstop: under requirement 4e the watchdog does the
# killing, and the backstop only bounds the pathological case of a session
# looping productively without converging, so it must sit clear of the
# durations the watchdog is expected to let through. They err high on purpose.
# The loss function is violently asymmetric: too generous costs the marginal
# minutes of a session that was going to fail anyway, at roughly a tenth of a
# dollar a minute and bounded by the lock above it, while too tight throws
# away everything — on the run that prompted this, $13.79 of Implementer work,
# $2.92 of Reviewer, an Enabler engagement, and the review gate itself.

# stage_budget_observations  < union JSONL on stdin
# One record per completed stage run, oldest first, as a JSON array:
#
#   {actor, repo, model, ts, duration_min, gap_max, killed}
#
# Three joins and one exclusion are worth naming:
#
#   the repository comes from the cycle, not the event, for most actors. A
#     `stage-end` names only its stage; the cycle it belongs to named its
#     repository in the `selection` event. `review-stage-end` carries its own.
#   the Enabler and its `enabler-adjudicate`/`enabler-decide` passes are keyed
#     `*` unconditionally. Neither has a repository naturally — the Enabler
#     (and the adjudication or decide pass it runs, requirements 36b/36d)
#     spans repositories — so pretending otherwise would fragment their
#     samples for no gain. The Monitor (`monitor-cycle.sh`, agent-ops#1284) is
#     keyed `*` by its caller for the same reason: it reads the fleet, not a
#     repository. Its own `stage-end` events live in `monitor-log.jsonl`, so
#     the Monitor concatenates that stream onto the shared one before taking
#     these observations — nothing here needs to know about the third stream,
#     only that the caller supplies it.
#   the Co-Ordinator is keyed by its own event's `repo` field when the event
#     carries one, and `*` otherwise (agent-ops#1629). Since the per-repository
#     split (agent-ops#1560/#587) each per-repository engagement's own
#     `stage-end` already names the repository it ran for (`extra.repo`,
#     threaded through `stage_budget_apply`), so its own field — never the
#     cycle-level `selection` join every other actor uses, which a
#     per-repository cycle no longer resolves to one repository — is what
#     names the cell. A Co-Ordinator event with none (every run before this
#     split shipped) still falls back to `*`; that `*` bucket is therefore a
#     fixed, historical pool from here on; see `stage_budget_table`'s own
#     `coordinator_pooled_backstop` for what it warm-starts.
#   a killed run contributes no duration. Its recorded length is its cap, not
#     its length: that is the censoring that makes fitting a cap to durations
#     self-defeating, and the fix begins with not pretending the observation
#     is one. It still counts as a run, and as a kill.
#   an event predating `kill_reason` is read the way it was true at the time:
#     exit 124 was a wall-clock kill and nothing else could produce it.

# stage_budget_table OBSERVATIONS_JSON SETTINGS_JSON NOW_ISO
# The whole derivation, as one object:
#
#   {settings, cutoff, cells: {<key>: {…}}, actors: {<actor>: {…}}}
#
# where a cell key is `<actor>|<repo>|<model>`.
#
# ## The cell is (actor, repository, model)
#
# Not (actor) — reviewing this repository costs three to four times what
# reviewing the others does, because every diff is checked against a
# five-thousand-line specification. Not (actor, repository) either: the
# strongest single predictor of how long a stage runs is the model it ran, and
# a cell that pools two of them has a bimodal duration distribution that no
# single moment or quantile describes. The complex-model reviews here run about
# twice as long at every quantile as the default-model ones and were killed
# roughly six times as often; pooling them gives a controller an average kill
# rate that is far too tight for one and needlessly loose for the other, and it
# converges for neither.
#
# Node is deliberately *not* a dimension, though nodes do differ in speed. It
# would divide the largest cell here to about eleven runs and the interesting
# one to about five, and no estimator recovers a distribution tail from five
# observations — while the tail is the entire quantity of interest. The
# thresholds are generous enough to absorb hardware variation instead.
#
# ## The watchdog threshold: a multiple of the largest gap seen
#
# `k x max(gap)`, and the choice of the *maximum* rather than a mean plus so
# many standard deviations is the load-bearing one. If a run is killed for
# inactivity at threshold T, its recorded maximum gap is T — censored — so the
# next threshold computed from it is k x T, which is larger. Censoring widens
# this estimator by construction. Under a mean-plus-sigma rule the same
# censored observation enters *below* its true value and pulls the estimate
# down, which tightens the threshold, which censors more: the death spiral.
# It also assumes nothing about the distribution, which matters because gaps
# are heavy-tailed — long test suites, continuous-integration waits, stalls.
#
# It is floored at the shipped prior and never narrows below it, whatever the
# data say. A threshold that tightens itself would reintroduce, from the other
# side, exactly the failure this mechanism exists to end.
#
# ## The backstop: multiplicative increase, additive decrease
#
# The mirror image of the congestion control everyone knows, and deliberately
# so. In a network the danger is a window grown too *large*, so it backs off
# hard and recovers slowly. Here the danger is a cap set too *small* — that is
# what destroys a stage — so the sharp, immediate move is upward and the
# cautious, gradual move is downward:
#
#   on a backstop kill        multiply. A kill is the only unambiguous
#                             evidence the cap is too tight, and it is exactly
#                             the censored observation that broke the
#                             estimator approach; here it is the control
#                             signal rather than a source of bias.
#   on sustained success      subtract a small step, and only when three
#                             things hold at once: a run of clean stages, an
#                             observed kill rate inside the objective, and a
#                             95th percentile that still sits well clear of
#                             the reduced cap.
#
# Floors and ceilings bound the fold: never below the value the fold started
# from, never below twice the observed 95th percentile of *completed* runs,
# and never above a fixed multiple of that same starting value. That value is
# the shipped prior for every cell but one — a warm-started Co-Ordinator
# repository cell starts from the frozen `*` pool instead (see
# `coordinator_pooled_backstop`), so its floor and ceiling scale with the
# seed it inherited rather than with the prior. When the floor and the ceiling
# disagree — a cell whose real durations have outgrown the ceiling — the floor
# wins. Throughput is a preference; discarding a finished stage is not.

# stage_budget_resolve TABLE ACTOR REPO MODEL [OVERRIDES]
# The two numbers this launch will use, and where each came from:
#
#   {backstop_min, inactivity_min, basis, source}
#
# Resolution order, most specific first (requirement 4f):
#
#   1. an explicit override for this (actor, repository)   config.json
#   2. an explicit override for this actor                 config.json
#   3. the adaptive value for this (actor, repository, model)
#   3a. for the Co-Ordinator only: the frozen `coordinator|*|<model>` cell
#       (issue #1629) — its own repo cell has not run even once yet, so
#       tier 3 has nothing, and the generic tier-4 pool below is coarser
#       than it needs to be (it folds every model together). This is what a
#       brand-new `coordinator|<repo>|<model>` cell resolves against on its
#       very first launch, before `stage_budget_table` has anything to put
#       in `cells` for it at all. It reports `basis: "pooled"`, the same
#       answer tier 4 gives for the same reason, and deliberately never the
#       frozen cell's own basis: that cell may well have enough runs to read
#       `own`, and announcing `own` for a repo cell with no runs at all would
#       be exactly the untraceable number requirement 4f's `basis` exists to
#       prevent.
#   4. the shrunk pooled value for this actor
#   5. the shipped prior                                   code
#
# The caller resolves 1 and 2 into OVERRIDES — `{backstop, inactivity}`, either
# a number or null — because it is the caller that holds the configuration; 3
# to 5 are decided here. Configuration outranks the derivation deliberately:
# an installation that has said what it wants is not to be argued with, and
# the pipeline never writes to `config.json`, so a self-tuning value can never
# turn into pull-request churn in somebody else’s repository.

# CONFIG_JSON is the parsed content of config.json, not a path, so this stays

# same threshold before any cycle runs) both call this rather than each
# keeping its own expression of "the widest configured cap per actor" — two
# independently maintained lists is exactly how they drifted before: doctor's
# own read once covered the plain key alone, so a per-repository override
# could pin an actor's backstop while the reported lock silently stayed
# narrower than the one agent-cycle.sh actually derived.

# The cycle lock must outlast a cycle that runs every stage to its limits, and
# every stage limit now moves. So the lock is *derived* from the backstops in
# force rather than asserted against them: the sum, over the six
# implementation actors, of the largest backstop each could be given this
# cycle, plus slack — in whole seconds, and never less than whatever the
# configuration asked for.
#
# Deriving it is the whole point. A constant checked against other constants
# has to be re-derived by hand every time any of them moves, and in the two
# days before this was written that arithmetic was redone three times, each
# raise forcing a knock-on recalculation somewhere else. It is also one fewer
# number an installation has to understand.
#
# The *largest*, not the one that will actually be used, and per actor rather
# than per cell: a cycle can land on any repository and any model, so the lock
# has to cover the worst case it could draw. Erring long is close to free —
# the holder of a dead lock is taken over on its pid, not on its age, so the
# threshold only bounds how long a *live but hung* process may hold on.
#
# OVERRIDES_JSON is `{<actor>: {backstop, inactivity}}`, the configured values
# the caller has already resolved; each is folded in as another candidate for
# that actor rather than as a replacement, for the same worst-case reason.
