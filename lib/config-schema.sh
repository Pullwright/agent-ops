# lib/config-schema.sh — validate config.json against config.schema.json.
#
# The schema is the machine-readable statement of what an installation may
# configure; this is what makes it enforceable. It exists because a
# configuration typo is the quietest failure this system has: a misspelled key
# is simply not read, and the pipeline runs on a default the operator never
# chose, for as many cycles as it takes someone to notice. `additionalProperties:
# false` throughout the schema turns that whole class loud.
#
# Deliberately a *subset* of JSON Schema, not an implementation of it: the
# keywords below are the ones config.schema.json actually uses, and the rule
# is that the schema may only use keywords this understands. A full validator
# would be a dependency (there is none available on a node beyond jq, git,
# perl and python3's standard library) or several hundred lines of jq; neither
# buys anything the product needs. Supported: type, enum, const, minimum,
# maximum, exclusiveMinimum, exclusiveMaximum, minLength, pattern, minItems,
# uniqueItems, contains, properties, required, additionalProperties (false
# only), items, and local `$ref`s into `#/$defs`.
#
# Also holds cross-key rules the schema itself cannot state — each holds
# *between* two keys (or two array entries) rather than about one, which is
# outside what `additionalProperties`/`required`/etc. on a single object can
# express. `config_enabler_assignee_ok`, `config_missing_plan_path_repos`,
# `config_model_tier_floor_violations`,
# `config_required_refinement_sources_without_refiner`,
# `config_required_failed_runs_source`,
# `config_refinement_sources_paused_by_cap` and
# `config_duplicate_repos_slugs` are `agent-cycle.sh`'s
# own startup guards (all `fail`/refuse except
# `config_refinement_sources_paused_by_cap`, which `warn`s, never refuses —
# see each function's own comment); `config_duplicate_project_review_slugs`
# is `review-cycle.sh`'s. `scripts/doctor.sh` calls every one of them so no
# pipeline's refusal or warning can ever drift from what `doctor.sh` reports.
#
# `config_model_tier_floor_violations` reads `lib/model-id.sh`'s
# `MODEL_TIER_RANK` table, through `model_tier_below`; both scripts that
# source this file also source that one, in whichever order, before either is
# ever called.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh and scripts/doctor.sh. jq 1.6 compatible: nodes
# carry 1.7, but a host running doctor.sh before installing anything may well
# have 1.6.
#
# `STAGE_BUDGET_PRIORS`, `stage_budget_all_overrides` and
# `stage_budget_lock_seconds` — needed below to floor `claim_ttl_hours` and
# `abandoned_draft_after_hours` at a cycle's own worst-case runtime — are
# lib/stage-budget.sh's, sourced here for the same self-containment reason
# lib/void-guard.sh sources its own dependencies: this file works whether
# agent-cycle.sh sources it first or a caller sources lib/config-schema.sh
# alone.

# config_defaults CONFIG_FILE SCHEMA_FILE
# Prints CONFIG_FILE merged with every default config.schema.json declares, so
# a caller reads a fully-populated object and never repeats a `// literal` of
# its own. A key already set — including inside a nested object or an array
# item such as `repos[]` — is left exactly as the config wrote it; a key that
# is absent *or explicitly `null`* takes the schema's `default` (the same two
# cases jq's own `//` treats as missing, which is the operator every call site
# this replaces used to spell out by hand). An object with no default of its
# own but whose properties do — `schedule` is the case in point — is still
# synthesised whole when absent, so every leaf under it reads its default too;
# a key with no schema default anywhere on its path (a required field with
# nothing to fall back to, `project_review.defaults.model` for instance)
# passes through unchanged. This performs no validation of its own — a config invalid against
# the schema is still merged, defaults and all, since a caller that wants the
# gate calls config_schema_errors first.
#
# A second pass follows the schema fill above, for the handful of keys whose
# intent was always "a few cycles", never a literal number of hours (or of
# cycle directories): `claim_ttl_hours`, `abandoned_draft_after_hours`,
# `disable_default_ttl`, `none_selected_recheck_hours`, `cycles_retained`,
# `state_local_cycles_retained` and `state_local_streams_retained` carry no
# schema `default` of their own any more, on the same "absent means derive"
# convention `lock_stale_after` already established (requirement 4f) — a jq
# `default` is a fixed literal and cannot express "derived from
# `schedule.cycle_interval_minutes`". Deriving here, once, is what requirement
# 1c calls "one defined home": every existing reader of this function's
# output — `lib/claim.sh`, `agent-cycle.sh`, the gatherers — keeps working
# unchanged, because what it reads is still a plain resolved number, just no
# longer a cadence-blind one. See requirement 1d for the formula and why it
# reads `schedule.cycle_hours` and `schedule.excluded_minutes` as well as
# `schedule.cycle_interval_minutes`.
#
# `claim_ttl_hours` and `abandoned_draft_after_hours` each bound a cycle's own
# *runtime*, not only the gap between cycle starts — `lib/claim.sh`'s `do_gc`
# sweeps a claim registry entry (and, with it, the untouched claim branch)
# past the first, and `scripts/gather-abandoned-drafts.sh` races the second
# against a claim that can itself already be swept — so each also carries the
# stage-backstop floor requirement 4f's own `lock_stale_after` derives
# (`stage_budget_lock_seconds`): the same shape as the cadence floor above, a
# value this derivation can only raise, never lower. Computed from
# `STAGE_BUDGET_PRIORS` and this config's own actor overrides
# (`stage_budget_all_overrides`) alone, with an empty budget table — never the
# fleet's own learned per-(actor, repository, model) history, which lives in
# an event log this function has no path to and would make it a function of
# more than `config_file` and `schema_file`. That is the same conservative,
# no-history baseline a fresh installation's `scripts/doctor.sh` and
# `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh` already fall back on before any cycle has
# run, applied here unconditionally rather than only until the first one has.

    #   `worst` — the longest an installation can go between two firings.
    #     Hours `cycle_hours` excludes contribute whole 60-minute penalties on

    #     `excluded_minutes` dropping a would-be firing rather than shifting
    #     it. This is what a threshold that must outlast a quiet stretch is
    #     sized against (`hour_key`).
    #   `mean` — a day divided by the number of firings in it. This is what a
    #     *count* of retained cycle directories is sized against
    #     (`count_key`): directories accrue at the installation'\''s throughput,
    #     so the wall-clock span a count covers follows the average gap, not
    #     the longest one. Sizing a retention count against `worst` would
    #     shrink the window exactly where `cycle_hours` is most restrictive —
    #     a `9-17` installation firing every 15 minutes would keep 14 cycle
    #     directories, some three hours of the eight days `cycles_retained`
    #     means to hold. The two coincide whenever `cycle_hours` allows every
    #     hour and `excluded_minutes` drops no reachable occurrence, which is
    #     every installation that has not restricted its schedule.

    # Each of the three inputs is taken only when it is the type this

    # performs no validation, so a config that would fail

# shipped behaviour, not this installation's, so it is never checked (an
# operator running below the ladder's `merge_autonomy` default, say, is not a
# documentation bug); a key with no `x-docs.value` at all, one whose
# `x-docs.value` is an object keyed `readme`/`spec` (the two documents assert
# different things there, so there is no one value to check the config
# against), and one with no schema `default` to differ from in the first
# place, are likewise skipped — each is a case this single-value comparison
# cannot be reduced to. "Differs" and "matches" are both judged on the parsed
# value a documented cell encodes, not its Markdown spelling: a documented
# `` `["a", "b"]` `` and a `default` of `["a","b"]` compare equal despite the
# whitespace, the same way `` `claude-sonnet-5` `` compares to the bare string
# it names and `*(unset)*` compares to an empty string — the same convention
# `scripts/render-config-table.sh`'s own header documents. The *reported*
# resolved value, when a mismatch is found, is rendered the way that script's
# `value_for` renders an unset `default` — a non-empty string bare in
# backticks, `*(unset)*` for an empty one, anything else as compact JSON in
# backticks — so a `scripts/doctor.sh` warning names the same cell a
# regenerated config table would show.

# config_project_review_repos DEFAULTED_CONFIG_JSON
# `project_review.repos`, each entry resolved against `project_review.defaults`
# per requirement 342's rule: a key present and non-null on the repo's own
# entry wins, `defaults[key]` otherwise; `slug` is never defaulted. One
# implementation shared by every reader (review-cycle.sh, scripts/doctor.sh,
# lib/labels.sh's caller) so they cannot resolve the same repository two
# different ways. Takes the already-`config_defaults`-merged config, as every
# caller already has one; prints `[]` (never fails) when `project_review` is
# absent or malformed, so a caller need not special-case the optional block.
#
# Each entry also carries `model_key`: the precise config path `model`'s
# value was resolved from — `project_review.repos[<i>].model` when this
# repository overrides it, `project_review.defaults.model` otherwise — so a
# caller passing `model` to `resolve_model_id` can name that path rather than
# the generic `project_review.model` in a resolution error.
#
# `review_instructions`/`review_context` (issue #589, D7) are arrays of
# paths, always — never a bare string, the same convention `prompt_overrides`'
# `extend` already uses (this schema's own minimal validator has no
# `oneOf`/`anyOf` to constrain a "string or array" shape). Absent everywhere
# resolves to `[]`, never `null`, so every reader can iterate it unconditionally.
# `repo_context_file` stays a bare string: it names one file inside the
# repository under review, never a list.
