# lib/merge-budget.sh — the `merge_budget_per_day` spend governor (D18,
# docs/reviews/2026-08-14-autonomy-investigation.md §5.4, WI-6 of umbrella
# #402).
#
# A rolling-24-hour cap on how many pull requests this pipeline may *land*
# in one repository, deterministically countable from GitHub's own merged-PR
# record — never a private counter this process keeps, which a restart or a
# second node would simply not share. `merge_budget_decide` is the pure
# read-side answer — `arm` (under cap), `hold` (cap reached — the budget
# approves the pull request but does not arm its landing; the backlog queues
# visibly rather than merging past the cap) or `refuse` (the count could not
# be established, which fails closed exactly like an unreadable kill switch:
# an ungoverned merge is worse than a merge deferred a cycle). `0` means
# unlimited and skips the count entirely — the off switch, on the same terms
# `stage_inactivity`'s per-actor `0` already uses.
#
# The counting anomaly this item also covers — more pull requests landed in
# the window than the cap ever permitted, which a correct governor should
# never observe — freezes the repository to `agent-approves` (one rung down
# from wherever it was, never all the way to `human`: the Approver App still
# reviews, only automatic landing stops) and escalates to a human, because a
# governor that is wrong about its own count is a fact worth a human's
# attention regardless of which direction it was wrong in.
#
# ## Where this is called from
#
# `run_landing_stage` (D18 WI-7, requirement 8d, `agent-cycle.sh`) is the one
# behaviour-affecting caller of `merge_budget_decide` and
# `merge_budget_apply_decision` — one of the gates the arming step re-reads
# fresh, immediately before it would otherwise land a pull request itself.
# `merge_autonomy_effective_level` is the other caller in this codebase — it
# calls `merge_budget_freeze_state` below regardless of whether the arming
# step ever runs, because a per-repo freeze is a fact about what level a
# repository is governed at independent of anything landing on the strength
# of that level, exactly the same reasoning that already applies to the
# fleet-wide kill switch. Both callers exist because `merge_autonomy` above
# `agent-approves` is still an explicit per-installation opt-in (product
# default `human` fleet-wide) — this file has been regression-tested
# (test/merge-budget.test.sh) since WI-6 landed, and is live wherever an
# operator has actually raised the level.
#
# ## Freeze record shape and the fail-open reading of its own reachability
#
# The freeze is a fleet flag, `fleet/merge-budget-freeze-<slug>.json` (slug
# slashes replaced with `-` — flag names are not paths), reusing
# `lib/toggle.sh`'s generic CAS-guarded contents-API machinery exactly as
# `lib/merge-autonomy.sh`'s kill switch does, under its own per-repo name.
# Unlike the kill switch (TD-PPagop-26081507), this flag's own reachability
# reads *open* (not frozen) on an unreachable state repo with no cached copy
# — deliberately the ordinary fleet-flag direction, not the kill switch's
# inverted one. The kill switch fails closed because an operator who pulled
# that lever needs it to hold even from a node that cannot currently confirm
# it; a freeze exists only because `merge_budget_decide` itself just observed
# a live counting anomaly on a reachable GitHub, so a node that cannot reach
# the *state* repo a moment later has no anomaly of its own to act on, and
# `scripts/doctor.sh` reports the freeze's state as it would any other flag.
#
# Sourced by `agent-cycle.sh` after `lib/toggle.sh` and `lib/github-limit.sh`
# (for `fleet_flag_*`, `GITHUB_PR_LIST_LIMIT` and `github_pr_list_truncated`)
# and by `scripts/doctor.sh` after `lib/toggle.sh` alone — doctor only ever
# calls the pure `merge_budget_effective_cap`, never the network-reading
# functions, so it has no need of `lib/github-limit.sh`. Both source it
# before `lib/merge-autonomy.sh`, which calls `merge_budget_freeze_state` —
# see that file's own shellcheck source note — though bash resolves that
# call at run time, not at source time, so the textual order does not
# actually matter; it is kept for readability alone.

# merge_budget_window_status SLUG PR_LABEL MERGED_LOGIN [NOW_ISO]
# STATUS<TAB>COUNT (the same compound-return idiom
# `fleet_flag_fetch_status` uses) — the rolling-24-hour count of SLUG's
# merged pull requests carrying PR_LABEL and merged by MERGED_LOGIN (the
# Approver App identity's own login, `approver_token_identity_login` —
# passed in rather than looked up here, so this file stays independent of
# `lib/approver-token.sh` and trivially testable with a plain string).
# STATUS is `ok` (COUNT is a non-negative integer), `unreadable` (the
# listing failed or did not parse) or `truncated` (the listing came back at
# `GITHUB_PR_LIST_LIMIT`, so a real count above the cap could be hiding
# behind an undercount below it — the dangerous direction for a governor,
# so this counts as unreadable, not as a floor to trust). NOW_ISO defaults
# to the current time and exists only so a test can pin the window without
# waiting for one.
#
# The listing is scoped to the window by GitHub's own `merged:>=<cutoff>`
# search qualifier, not merely filtered to it afterwards, and that is a
# correctness requirement rather than a saving. `gh pr list` returns the
# most recently *created* pull requests, so an unscoped `--state merged`
# listing enumerates the whole lifetime history of the label: every
# repository this fleet governs passes `GITHUB_PR_LIST_LIMIT` merged
# labelled pull requests within weeks and never comes back under it, at
# which point the listing is truncated on every single call and this
# function can only ever answer `truncated` — `arm`, `hold` and the anomaly
# freeze all become permanently unreachable. Scoped, the page cap bounds the
# *window* instead, so reaching it means 60-odd pull requests genuinely
# landed in 24 hours, which is a real anomaly and rightly refuses.
#
# The qualifier only has to be a *superset* of the window: the `jq` filter
# below still decides the count on an exact `mergedAt >= cutoff` comparison,
# so nothing depends on GitHub honouring the time component (it does; it
# would remain correct if it rounded the qualifier to whole days). What it
# does depend on is the search index, which is eventually consistent — a
# merge from the last few seconds may not appear yet, undercounting by one.
# That is the dangerous direction, and it is accepted deliberately: an
# undercount of one on a 24-hour window is strictly better than a count that
# is never established at all, and the cycle's own 15-minute tick keeps the
# exposure to a merge landing inside the same tick that reads it.

# so a failure here never turns a `hold` into a `refuse`). This is the

# work item that arms landing may apply a tighter one of its own on top.
#
# `--search "sort:created-asc draft:false"` (PR #499 review follow-up; the
# `draft:false` qualifier added by issue #513, PR #506 review follow-up) asks
# GitHub to order the listing itself and drop drafts from it, so `first`
# after `sort_by` names the true oldest *non-draft* regardless of the
# `--limit` page cap: unscoped, `gh pr list` returns the newest-created page,
# and past `GITHUB_PR_LIST_LIMIT` open labelled pull requests the local
# `sort_by(.createdAt) | first` above would silently name the oldest of that
# newest page — not the oldest waiting, the one thing this function exists to
# name — with nothing to say it had missed the real one. `draft:false` closes
# a second way the same page cap could miss it: without it, a page whose
# `GITHUB_PR_LIST_LIMIT` oldest entries are all drafts leaves nothing for the
# local `select(.isDraft | not)` filter below to find, and this reports
# `null` — no backlog at all — even though an older non-draft is waiting just

#     "waiting_backlog":null}`, with no count attempted at all — unlimited
#     means unlimited, not "count anyway and never trip".
#   - the window unreadable or truncated → `{"decision":"refuse", "cap":
#     <cap>, "count":null, "anomaly":false, "waiting_backlog":null}` — an
#     uncountable spend must never read as clearance to land.
#   - `count + ALREADY_ARMED < cap` → `arm`.
#   - otherwise → `hold`, with `waiting_backlog` filled from
#     `merge_budget_oldest_waiting`. Not `arm`: a full budget approves a
#     pull request's *content* through the ordinary review path, never its
#     landing.
#   - `count > cap` → `hold` as above, plus `anomaly: true` — a fact this
#     function only reports; `merge_budget_apply_decision` is what acts on
#     it (freeze and escalate).
#
# ALREADY_ARMED (default 0; PR #557 review of TD-PPagop-26081701) is how many
# pull requests this same pass has *already* armed but that GitHub's own
# merged-PR record — what `merge_budget_window_status` counts — cannot see
# yet: enqueuing or auto-merging does not merge synchronously, so a caller
# offering more than one candidate to this function inside one pass (the 2.1e
# landing-retry sweep, `_landing_retry_sweep_repo`) must fold its own running
# tally in itself, or every candidate in the pass reads the same
# not-yet-merged `count` and all of them arm. ALREADY_ARMED only ever tightens
# the `arm`/`hold` boundary — the `count` and `anomaly` this function reports
# stay exactly what `merge_budget_window_status` read, because `anomaly` must
# describe a real overshoot GitHub's own record confirms, never this pass's
# own caution about pull requests that have not landed yet.
#
# Pure but for its two reads (the window count, the backlog listing): no log
# events, no freeze writes. `merge_budget_apply_decision` below is the

# "enabled"}` (not frozen) or `{"state":"disabled","record":{...}}` (frozen).
# RAW-only, exactly as `fleet_disabled_state` uses for every other ordinary
# fleet flag: an unreachable state repo with no cache and a genuinely clear
# flag both read as "not frozen" here — see the header for why this, unlike
# the kill switch, does not need TD-PPagop-26081507's fail-closed inversion.
#
# FRESH (issue #513) skips this process's memo for the one call — the same
# escape `fleet_flag_fetch_status`'s own FRESH argument provides, for the same
# reason: a caller taking an outward action under the answer must see a freeze
# another process set at the moment it decides, rather than replaying the
# answer this cycle's first read memoised. D18 WI-7's arming step is that
# site, and `merge_autonomy_effective_level` passes its own FRESH through to
# here, so that function's promise — the kill switch *and* a WI-6 budget
# freeze both bind at the moment of decision — holds for the freeze too.
#
# A fresh read calls `fleet_flag_fetch_status` directly, because
# `fleet_flag_fetch` deliberately forwards neither MODE nor FRESH (that is
# what keeps its contract byte-identical for its three original callers).
# MODE is passed empty, so this flag's fail-open direction is untouched: only
# the memo is bypassed, never the `clear`-vs-`unreachable` resolution, and an

# unlike a crash loop or a usage-limit freeze, this anomaly is a fact about
# one repository, not the fleet, so it belongs in that repository's own
# backlog — the same reasoning `approver_escalate` already applies). Calls
# `log_event` directly rather than returning something for a caller to log,
# on the same "assume the caller has already sourced it" terms this file
# assumes for `fleet_flag_*` — `log_event` is defined by `agent-cycle.sh`
# itself, the one process that ever calls this function for real.
#
# Deduplicated the same way `create_escalation_issue` dedups every other
# escalation (an open issue in SLUG already naming this item ref) — but this
# file cannot call that function directly (it lives in agent-cycle.sh, not a

# an escalation a human has not yet closed must not be re-filed every time
# the arming step reconsiders this repository.
#
# `merge-budget-frozen` also carries `reason` (a short, deterministic
# rendering of the same anomaly `merge_budget_freeze_set`'s own flag body
# already states in full) and `waiting_backlog` (the same value just logged
# on `merge-budget-hold`, one call above this one in the same case): D18
# issue #574 wants a dashboard tick to be able to show *why* a repository is
