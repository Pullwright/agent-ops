# lib/labels.sh — the pipeline creates its own labels at the point of use, in
# every repository it gathers data for, rather than requiring a human to
# create them first or only reaching a repository once it is selected to work.
#
# Every label this system applies is one an operator had to create by hand, in
# every target repository, before it would do anything. Nothing failed loudly
# when they had not: `refinement_label_add` swallows the error and records the
# block anyway, `create_escalation_issue` retries without the label, and the
# item goes on being handled while the *signal to the human* — the thing the
# label exists to be — silently does not appear. Poetic's own installation had
# drifted exactly that way by August 2026: three of its repositories were
# missing between one and four of the labels the pipeline projects onto their
# items, and no cycle had ever said so — worse in a repository the pipeline
# had not yet selected work in, which got no ensure at all until it did
# (agent-ops#687).
#
# That is a product bug rather than a Poetic quirk (the customer-zero rule in
# docs/ROADMAP.md): a new installation should not need a checklist of `gh label
# create` commands to be functional, and a label a human deletes should come
# back on its own. So the Script ensures its labels exist in every repository
# it gathers data for, not only the one it goes on to work — one cheap listing
# per repository per `labels_ensure_interval_hours` (default 24h, a per-repo
# stamp file under `state_dir`), and a create only for what is genuinely
# absent.
#
# Three properties are deliberate:
#
#   - **It only ever creates.** A label that already exists is left exactly as
#     it is, whatever its colour or description. Operators recolour and
#     re-describe labels, and a pipeline that reasserted its own idea of them
#     every cycle would be undoing that work on a schedule.
#   - **It can never fail a cycle.** A repository this cannot list, or a token
#     without permission to create, yields a report and nothing else. The
#     tolerances the callers already carry stay exactly where they are: this
#     makes the common case work, it does not become a new thing that breaks.
#   - **It is periodic, not once-forever.** A repository already fully
#     labelled costs a stat against its stamp file, not a listing — but the
#     check repeats every interval rather than stopping after the first
#     success, which is what keeps "a label a human deletes comes back on its
#     own" true for as long as the repository is configured.
#
# `labels_ensure_one` is the single-label primitive `refinement_label_add`
# (lib/refinement.sh) self-heals through when a projection's add fails: the
# ensure above is periodic, not synchronous with every write, so a projection
# can still race a repository whose stamp has not been refreshed yet.
#
# `labels_reconcile`/`labels_reconcile_role` give the three properties above
# up for any label named under `label_prefix` (config.schema.json, default
# `pw::`): create, reconcile colour/description drift, and delete once no
# longer catalogued — full ownership of that namespace, never touching a
# label outside it. TD-PPagop-26082809 wired every call site in
# agent-cycle.sh, review-cycle.sh, lib/enabler.sh and lib/candidate-gather.sh
# onto `labels_reconcile_role`/`labels_reconcile_stamped` and moved the four
# genuinely per-installation-configurable defaults below
# (`enabler_escalation_label`, `needs_refinement_label`, `refined_label`,
# `unvoid_label`; `pr_label` has no product default to move) under that
# namespace. `blocked`, `blocked:needs-refinement`, `obsolete`,
# `open-question` and `complexity:low|medium|high` stay unprefixed
# deliberately, not as work left undone: each is documented fixed and
# non-configurable elsewhere in this codebase for a reason that renaming
# would defeat rather than honour — `obsolete` in particular
# (`lib/void-guard.sh`) is hand-applied by a human from memory, and a rename
# would desync the label the pipeline reads from the one a human actually
# types, silently disabling requirement 34k's own corroboration. Read
# `lib/landing.sh`'s `LANDING_OPEN_QUESTION_LABEL` comment for `open-question`'s
# own version of the same argument. Moving these five is out of scope for
# this change; see agent-ops#1013's own thread for the open question this
# left for a maintainer.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh and review-cycle.sh.

# The product's own labels, with the colour and description a fresh
# installation gets. Names come from config — an installation may rename any of
# them — but a name it does not set (the empty value that switches a projection
# off) yields nothing to create.
#
# `blocked` is the exception that proves the interface: it is not
# configurable, and is read by scripts/gather-issues.sh as an exclusion.
# Originally applied only by a human; since agent-ops#639 the Script projects
# it too, onto the issue behind a needs-refinement block (requirement 38b),
# alongside `blocked:needs-refinement` naming why — a fixed pair, also not
# configurable, that replaced assigning `enabler_assignee` to that same issue.
# Creating both is how an installation gets the human-hand-applied control at
# all — a repository without the label offers the human no way to say "not
# this one" — and is what lets the Script's own projection reach a repository
# it has not otherwise ensured labels in yet.
# `obsolete` is the same kind of exception, for the same reason: it is not
# configurable, and no pipeline stage may ever apply it — lib/void-guard.sh's
# `void_finishing_pr_reason` reads it as a human's own corroboration that a
# still-open, still-diff-carrying `pr-<n>-abandoned-…`/`pr-<n>-review-…` draft
# is genuinely unwanted, and a stage that could apply the label itself could
# corroborate its own judgement with it (TD-PPagop-26081308).
# `pw::type:tech-debt` is a fixed name too, for a third reason: it is D24's
# trust anchor for tech debt filed as an issue rather than an in-repo
# register record (D15, agent-ops#872) — only a collaborator with triage can
# apply a label, so an issue's membership of the `tech-debt` work band is
# trustable even though its body stays untrusted data. A configurable name
# would let anything in the untrusted band claim membership by renaming
# itself to whatever the operator picked.
# `pw::owner-decision` (agent-ops#938) is fixed for the same reason:
# `lib/tech-debt-file.sh`'s `techdebt_file_issue` applies it, on the
# Approver's/Enabler's own say-so, to mark a filed issue as carrying an
# owner-only choice rather than a knowable fix — the Refiner reads it to
# decide between specifying to a stated default and declining with
# `needs-refinement` (prompts/refiner.md, requirement 39d), so a configurable
# name here would let a renamed label silently stop being read the same way
# everywhere this system checks for it.
# `pw::decision` (agent-ops#937) is fixed for the same reason again: it is
# what `scripts/sweep-decision-vetoes.sh` searches for across every
# configured repository to find decision logs to check for a veto (a
# reopen), so a renamed label would silently stop being swept.
# `pw::pager` (agent-ops#1278) is fixed for the same reason again: it is
# what lib/pager.sh's own dedup search and auto-close read to find a firing
# invariant's own tracking issue, in `pager_repo`, so a renamed label would
# silently stop being found — the same failure mode a renamed `pw::decision`
# would have on `scripts/sweep-decision-vetoes.sh`.
#
# **`target`'s catalogue is a superset of `escalation`'s, and must stay one.**
# `labels_reconcile_role` reconciles `target` under MODE `full`, which deletes
# every `label_prefix`-named label in the repository that `target`'s own
# catalogue does not name — so any prefixed label another role wants in a
# repository that is *also* a target has to appear in `target`'s arm too, or
# the two roles fight over it: `escalation` creates it, `target` deletes it on
# the next cycle, and GitHub's own DELETE detaches it from every issue already
# carrying it. This is not hypothetical for `pw::pager`: `pager_repo` falls
# back to `crash_loop_repo`, and an installation that points that at a
# repository it also works — Poetic's own does — would have had every open
# page's label stripped, leaving lib/pager.sh's dedup search and
# monitor-cycle.sh's own `--label pw::pager` listing finding nothing.
# `pw::decision` and `enabler_escalation_label` were already in both arms for
# their own reasons; `pw::pager` is in both for this one.
# `test/labels.test.sh` pins the superset relation directly, so a future
# `escalation`-only entry fails there rather than in production.

# labels_catalogue CONFIG_FILE SCHEMA_FILE ROLE [REVIEW_PR_LABEL]
# Print the labels a repository in ROLE needs, one per line, as
# `name<TAB>colour<TAB>description`. ROLE is one of:
#   target      — a repository the implementation pipeline works
#   review      — a repository the project-review pipeline reviews
#   escalation  — where escalation issues are filed (crash_loop_repo,
#                 pager_repo)
#
# REVIEW_PR_LABEL is used only for ROLE "review": project_review's pr_label is
# resolved per repository (requirement 342 — an entry in `project_review.repos`
# may override `project_review.defaults.pr_label`), so there is no longer one
# global value this function could read out of the config itself. The caller
# already knows the specific repository's effective label — review-cycle.sh
# resolves it once per repo, scripts/doctor.sh once per configured entry — and
# passes it through here rather than this function re-deriving a single value
# that no longer exists.
#
# Reads config_defaults's merge rather than CONFIG_FILE directly (issue #197),
# so the label names below take config.schema.json's `default` without
# repeating it here; config_defaults is assumed sourced by the caller, as
# every caller of this file already sources lib/config-schema.sh.

# labels_ensure_role's own shape, but through labels_reconcile: reads

# catalogue against it, MODE derived from ROLE — `full` for `target`, the one
# catalogue call that is a repository's complete desired label set;
# `additive` for every other role, each a partial subset of `target`'s own
# catalogue whose own deletion pass would remove labels `target` still wants
# (labels_reconcile's own comment above). A CONFIG_FILE/SCHEMA_FILE that
# cannot be read leaves PREFIX empty, the same safe fallback
# labels_reconcile's own empty-PREFIX path gives every other caller: nothing
# is reconciled or deleted, only ever created.
#
# The catalogue is captured into a variable rather than piped straight
# through, and MODE is downgraded to `additive` when that capture is empty —

# Internal: the rate-limited wrapper labels_ensure_stamped/
# labels_reconcile_stamped both are, parameterized on STAGE_FN — the
# labels_ensure_role/labels_reconcile_role-shaped function that actually
# ensures — so the two public wrappers below cannot drift apart on the
# stamp-file logic itself.
#
# Ensures ROLE's catalogue in REPO at most once per INTERVAL_HOURS (requirement
# 6a, agent-ops#687), so a repository this system has already labelled costs
# nothing beyond a stat(2) once the first listing has run. Keyed per
# (REPO, ROLE) via its own stamp file under STATE_DIR/labels-ensured/, so one
# repository's — or one role's — interval elapsing says nothing about
# another's. Deliberately periodic rather than once-forever: requirement 6a's
# own promise is that a label a human deletes comes back on its own, and that
# only stays true if the check repeats.
#
# The stamp is touched only after a listing actually succeeds: a repository
# whose labels could not be listed (STAGE_FN's own advisory failure,
# propagated here) leaves no stamp, so the very next cycle tries again rather
# than waiting out a whole interval on a failure this never actually paid for.
#
# INTERVAL_HOURS <= 0, or unset/non-numeric, disables the stamp check
# entirely: every call ensures. It is read as whole hours, from the value's
# integer part — see the truncation below for why a decimal reaches here at
# all. Prints STAGE_FN's own report (nothing, on a skipped call) and returns
# its exit status (0 on a skipped call — a rate-limited repeat is success, not
# a failure to check).

# decision. Fixed, regardless of config: `blocked` (selection exclusion,
# requirement 16.4), `blocked:*` (the needs-refinement pair requirement 38b
# projects alongside it), `obsolete` (void corroboration, requirement 34k),
# `complexity:*` (Reviewer/Approver tiering, requirement 8a),
# `pw::type:tech-debt` (D24's tech-debt trust anchor), `pw::owner-decision`
# (the Refiner's default-first rule, requirement 39d),
# `pw::decision` (`scripts/sweep-decision-vetoes.sh`'s own sweep target), and
# `open-question` (the landing gate's open-scope-question hold, requirement
# 8f) — every one of these is read somewhere in this pipeline today, not
# only the handful the issue that added this function named as illustration,
# because the invariant that makes minting safe ("nothing may read a minted
# label to decide anything") has to hold against what the pipeline actually
# reads, not against a partial list of it. Then every non-empty configured
# label name — `pr_label`, `enabler_escalation_label`,
# `needs_refinement_label`, `refined_label`, `unvoid_label` — read the same
# way `labels_catalogue` reads them, from `config_defaults`'s merge rather
# than CONFIG_FILE directly, so a renamed key is covered without repeating
# its default here, plus every project-review pull-request label in force:
# `project_review.defaults.pr_label` and each repository's own override of
# it. That last one is resolved per repository rather than globally, so
# `labels_catalogue` deliberately takes it as an argument instead — but the
# reserved set is a superset by design, the union of every value in force
# anywhere (`scripts/doctor.sh`'s own review-label check reads them the same
# way), because `review-cycle.sh` skips a repository's whole review while an
# open pull request carries that label: a minted one claiming the name would
# be read to decide something, which is exactly what may never happen. A
# future gate that wants to read a label adds that name here in the same
# change — this function is the one place the reserved set is declared, so
# nothing else needs to duplicate it.

# labels_mint REPO KIND NUMBER LABELS_JSON [CAP] < RESERVED_NAMES
# Mint and apply a stage's own suggested labels (requirement 6c, issue #714)
# — LABELS_JSON is that stage's unvalidated `[{name, colour?, description?},
# ...]` array — onto REPO's issue or pull request NUMBER. KIND is `issue` or
# `pr`, selecting whether `gh issue edit` or `gh pr edit` applies it.
# RESERVED_NAMES arrives on stdin, one per line — `labels_reserved_names`'s
# own shape, composed once by the caller so this function stays free of
# config-file access. CAP (default 3, requirement 6c's own per-item
# suggestion) bounds how many entries this single call may apply; checked
# before validation, so a refusal never itself counts against it, and a
# caller spanning several items in one engagement (the Refiner) can pass a
# smaller CAP once its own per-engagement total is close to its own limit.
#
# Each accepted name is created if absent (`labels_ensure_one`, the same
# neutral-grey default it already gives a caller with no colour of its own)
# and then applied. Prints one JSON object:
#   {"created": [...], "applied": [...], "refused": [{"name": ..., "reason": ...}, ...]}
# `applied` is every name that ended up on the issue/PR; `created` is the
# subset of those that did not already exist as a label in REPO; `refused`
# names one of `empty`/`too-long`/`invalid-name`/`reserved` (labels_validate_
# name's own words), `cap`, `create-failed` or `apply-failed` for everything
# else. Never fails the caller: an unusable REPO/KIND/NUMBER, or an empty or
# malformed LABELS_JSON, still prints the (all-empty) object rather than
# raising an error, and an entry that is not an object at all is refused
# `empty` on its own rather than costing the entries around it — minting is
# advisory by design (requirement 6c), and a stage's own verdict or PR must
# never turn on whether it succeeded.
