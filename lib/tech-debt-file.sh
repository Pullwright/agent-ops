# lib/tech-debt-file.sh — file deferred work on the Script's own behalf
# (agent-ops#631), for a stage that must never write to GitHub or a branch
# itself: the Approver ("What you must never do": never write code, push,
# amend the branch, or write to GitHub at all) and the Enabler (same rule,
# and it runs with no clone of any repo at all). Both may set `file_debt` or
# `file_issue` in their final JSON; the Script is what actually files it,
# under the calling stage's own identity where one applies.
#
# techdebt_file_issue REPO ITEM_REF TITLE BODY_FILE [TOKEN] [DEFAULT_FIX] \
#                      [OWNER_DECISION]
#   Files one plain GitHub issue, or returns an existing one that already
#   covers ITEM_REF. No label or assignee — unlike an escalation
#   (create_escalation_issue) this is not addressed at a specific human and
#   is legitimate autonomous work for a later cycle to pick up, not a
#   request excluded from the `issues` source. Prints "<number>\t<url>" on
#   success; prints nothing and returns 1 otherwise.
#
#   DEFAULT_FIX/OWNER_DECISION (agent-ops#938): see techdebt_default_section
#   below for what they add to the filed body, and pw::owner-decision for
#   what OWNER_DECISION additionally applies here — a fresh issue only; the
#   dedup hit above returns the existing issue untouched, label included. A
#   refused labelled create is retried once without the label, so a repository
#   that has not had `pw::owner-decision` ensured yet still gets its issue.
#
# techdebt_file_debt REPO TITLE BODY PROVENANCE [TOKEN] [DEFAULT_FIX] \
#                     [OWNER_DECISION]
#   Files TITLE/BODY as a GitHub issue in REPO labelled `pw::type:tech-debt`
#   (D15 as revised, agent-ops#869/#872/#874) — the same trust anchor
#   scripts/gather-tech-debt.sh reads to serve the band, and the one
#   `lib/labels.sh` ensures exists in every target repository. Deduped first
#   against REPO's own open `pw::type:tech-debt` issues by normalised title
#   (_techdebt_title_dedup_match, below): a match gets BODY/PROVENANCE as a
#   comment instead of a second filing, the "don't file a duplicate" outcome
#   applied automatically here. That search states its own
#   page cap (TECHDEBT_DEDUP_LIST_LIMIT, below) rather than inheriting `gh`'s
#   default of 30. Prints "<number>\t<url>" on
#   success — the new issue's, or the matched one's — and prints nothing and
#   returns 1 otherwise.
#
#   Retired by this move (agent-ops#874): the `td/<id>` reservation
#   (scripts/reserve-tech-debt-id.pl), the `td-record/<id>` filing branch,
#   the filing pull request, and `_techdebt_unfile`'s rollback of both —
#   filing is now the one API call techdebt_file_issue already makes for a
#   plain issue, plus the label and the dedup rule above. There is no
#   multi-step write left to half-finish, so there is no cleanup path either:
#   a create either succeeds or it doesn't, and a repository that does not
#   yet carry `pw::type:tech-debt` (the label-ensure pass has not reached it
#   yet) gets one retry without the label rather than a lost filing — logged
#   to errlog, the same shape techdebt_file_issue's own `pw::owner-decision`
#   retry already has. Nothing reconciles the result: the unlabelled issue is
#   invisible by construction to every label-based reader of this band,
#   including the archive mirror's own audits (agent-ops#1223).
#
# TECHDEBT_RECORD_BRANCH_PREFIX — no longer minted by this file
# (agent-ops#874 retired techdebt_file_debt's own td-record/<id> branch), but
# kept here as a constant rather than deleted: scripts/sweep-orphan-branches.sh
# and scripts/publish-tech-debt-archive.sh both source this file for it, to
# sweep and audit any td-record/<id> branch/pull request a pre-#874 filing
# already left behind, in a target repository this pipeline still gathers
# from. Deleting the constant would break both scripts' own sourcing rather
# than the (now dormant) minting it used to name.

# TECHDEBT_DEDUP_LIST_LIMIT — the page cap techdebt_file_debt's dedup search
# states rather than inherits, for the reason lib/candidate-gather.sh's own
# `gh issue list` states its: `gh`'s undeclared default of 30 truncates the
# listing silently, and a truncated listing is indistinguishable from a
# complete one. The direction of harm here is not mild — a dedup that cannot
# see an issue files a duplicate against it, the one outcome the dedup exists
# to prevent — and it does not self-heal, because the listing is newest-first
# and the debt most likely to be re-noticed is the oldest. agent-ops alone
# carries well over a hundred open `pw::type:tech-debt` issues, so the
# inherited cap would have hidden most of its own register from every filing.
# A listing that comes back *at* the cap is logged to the error log rather
# than passed off as complete.
