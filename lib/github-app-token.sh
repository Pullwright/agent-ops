# lib/github-app-token.sh — GitHub App installation-token minting, generalised
# over identity (D18 §5.3 WI-4, agent-ops#407; generalised by agent-ops#607
# Phase 2). Written first for one caller only — the Pullwright Approver
# (lib/approver-token.sh) — and generalised once a second identity needed the
# identical dance against a different App/installation/key: the forge
# authoring App (lib/author-token.sh, D18 decision 1). The mechanics live here
# exactly once; each identity's own file is a thin wrapper supplying its own
# environment variable names, cache-file prefix and override variables, so a
# fix or a new capability here reaches both callers at once.
#
# `gh` cannot mint an installation token on its own — it authenticates as an
# owner PAT or a user OAuth token — so every function below does the
# three-step dance by hand: sign a short-lived JWT with the App's private
# key, exchange it for an installation token (~1 h lifetime), cache the
# result until shortly before it expires.
#
# Every function is parameterised rather than reading a fixed set of
# environment variables — it carries no identity of its own. A caller passes
# its own app id, installation id, key path, cache directory, cache-file
# prefix, and `curl`/`openssl` binaries (or their test stubs) positionally;
# nothing here ever reads `PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_*`, `PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_*`, or
# any other identity-specific name directly.
#
# Fail-closed, by design: `github_app_token_credential_present` is the
# identity check on its own; every minting/reading function returns a
# distinct non-zero status (2) when the credential is not configured or not
# readable, so a caller can tell "there is nothing to check" apart from
# "GitHub refused the request" (1) — a caller must treat both alike as *gate
# unreadable, hand back*, never as a gate read and passed, but the
# distinction is worth keeping for anyone reading a log. There is no fallback
# to any other credential anywhere in this file: it references only the
# identity values a caller passes in, so an absent App key can never silently
# reroute a call through some other credential — that decision belongs to the
# caller (see the credential seam's own degrade-path logic — lib/forge-auth.sh
# names it, lib/gh-shim.sh's `gh_shim_resolve_token` applies it — which is
# deliberately not here).
#
# The minted token is never written to persistent storage and never logged.
# Every function below prints only the token (or, for the read-only calls,
# the data GitHub returned) to stdout — every error path prints a diagnosis,
# never the token or the JWT that produced it — and the JWT itself travels to
# `curl` on stdin, never in argv, where it would sit world-readable in
# /proc/<pid>/cmdline for the length of the call. The one cache this file
# keeps is best-effort and tmpfs-only, keyed by installation id so one
# installation's token is never served for another's, mode 600, written
# `mktemp`-then-rename so no reader sees a partial write, kept in a directory
# private to this user, and read back only when the file is this user's own —
# a cache directory's filesystem type and ownership are checked before
# anything is written, so a disk-backed or shared override disables caching
# rather than putting a live token on disk or within another user's reach.
#
# Sourced, never executed: it sets no shell options, so a caller's own
# `set -euo pipefail` or `set -uo pipefail` decides.
