# shellcheck disable=SC2154,SC2034  # this file's functions read and write the cycle's own globals — assigned by agent-cycle.sh, which sources every lib/*.sh file into one process (#771) — never locally; each function's own header names which ones.
#
# lib/manage.sh — the management commands (`--status`, `--disable`,
# `--enable`, `--clear-limit`, `--kill-merge-autonomy`, …): everything
# `agent-cycle.sh` does *instead of* running a cycle.
#
# Split out of agent-cycle.sh (#771). The seam is the sharpest one left in
# that file: these run before the lock and before any `gh` call, share none
# of the cycle's own phases, and every branch of them ends the process — so
# nothing below the call site can be reached from here, and nothing here is
# reachable from a cycle that runs. What is left in the spine is the one
# `run_manage_command` call, in the place the block occupied.
#
# `--status` must stay usable — and instant — while a cycle holds the lock,
# since "is one running right now?" is the question it is most often asked,
# and the switch's transitions are logged like any other state change: an
# operator finding cycles stopped is owed the same evidence trail as one
# finding them failing, and `disabled`/`enabled` events are what let the
# dashboard say why.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh only. Reads the cycle's own globals
# (`MANAGE_ACTION`, `SCRIPT_DIR`, `state_dir`, `state_repo`, `workspace_root`,
# `lock_file`, `review_lock_file`, `disable_default_ttl_hours`, `DISABLE_FOR`,
# `DISABLE_UNTIL`, `DISABLE_REASON`, `THIS_NODE`, …) directly, and — like
# `run_standdown_checks` (lib/standdown.sh) — deliberately declares nothing
# `local`, so the call is indistinguishable, to the rest of the cycle, from
# the inline block it replaces. `exit` inside it ends the process exactly as
# it did inline: nothing here runs inside a subshell.
