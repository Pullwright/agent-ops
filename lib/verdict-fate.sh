# lib/verdict-fate.sh — pairing an Approver verdict with the pull request's
# eventual fate (D18, agent-ops#573).
#
# The divergence figure that justified entering Stage 2 (#402's 2026-08-18
# amendment) was assembled by hand, pull request by pull request, because
# nothing recorded the pairing durably. `agent-cycle.sh`'s `run_approver_stage`
# already writes the verdict half live, as an `approver-verdict` event
# (docs/spec/implementation/requirements requirement 33) — `repo`, `tier`,
# `model`, `verdict`, `refuse_streak`, `adjudication`, `posted` (whether the
# GitHub review this verdict describes actually reached GitHub). This file is
# the read side: given that event log plus a small amount of live GitHub
# state, it joins the two into one entry per pull request and classifies
# agreement vs divergence. `scripts/verdict-fate-report.sh` is the I/O
# wrapper that fetches the live state and renders a report; the D18 stage-1
# `divergence` criterion in `scripts/autonomy-stage-report.sh` calls the same
# functions rather than recomputing the join itself (agent-ops#571 must
# consume this record, not re-derive it).
#
# ## One entry per pull request: the *latest* verdict wins, but not for every field
#
# A pull request can carry more than one `approver-verdict` event — a refusal
# the Implementer then addresses, followed by an approval once the Reviewer
# and Approver re-run, or an approval, a human `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, and a
# second approval once the `review-feedback` source brings the pull request
# back round. The entry this file reports is always the most recent by `ts`:
# an early refusal that was later superseded is not "the" verdict this pull
# request's eventual fate is judged against, only its last one is. The one
# exception is `first_approve_ts` (`verdict_fate_latest_per_pr`): the window a
# standing human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` is tested against is the *earliest*
# `APPROVE`, not the latest verdict's own `ts` — otherwise a human review that
# lands between two approvals reads as coming "before" the (later) one this
# entry reports, and the divergence it represents never surfaces
# (agent-ops#661).
#
# ## Verdict vocabulary vs GitHub's own
#
# `approver-verdict`'s own `verdict` field carries the model's vocabulary
# (`approve`/`refuse`/`land`/`escalate`/an adjudication's own `refuse`) —
# `verdict_fate_posted_review` maps that, together with `adjudication`, onto
# the two GitHub review events the Script ever actually posts:
# `APPROVE`/`REQUEST_CHANGES`. This mapping is fixed application logic, not a
# runtime fact, so it is safe to recompute for events written before this
# file existed — no backfill needed for old events to be readable.
#
# ## Divergence is symmetric, and one fate is never collapsed
#
# `verdict_fate_classify` compares the *posted* review against what actually
# happened next:
#
#   - An `APPROVE` diverges if the pull request closed unmerged, or if a
#     human posted a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` after the approval — this second
#     case is `changes-requested-after-approval`, its own fate, never folded
#     into `closed-unmerged` even when the pull request is later fixed and
#     lands anyway (the issue's own "sharp edge": this is the specific signal
#     Stage 1/2 exist to observe, and it must never be silently dropped). It
#     agrees if the pull request landed (by the Script or by a human) with no
#     such request against it.
#   - A `REQUEST_CHANGES` diverges if the pull request landed anyway (a human
#     overrode the standing refusal) — `landed-by-script` cannot happen here,
#     since the arming step never lands a pull request the Approver refused.
#     It agrees if the pull request closed unmerged (the human concurred).
#   - Either way, a pull request still open with no standing
#     `CHANGES_REQUESTED` is `pending` — not yet resolved, excluded from the
#     agreement/divergence rate rather than guessed at.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shell options are set here, matching every
# other lib/*.sh — the caller owns those. Every function here is pure: it
# reads only its arguments, so it is directly unit-testable
# (test/verdict-fate.test.sh) without a live GitHub read.

# verdict_fate_posted_review VERDICT ADJUDICATION
# Print `APPROVE`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or empty (no review was ever attempted
# for this verdict — an adjudication `escalate`, or a verdict the stage did
# not recognise). ADJUDICATION is `true`/`false` (or unset, read as `false`).

# verdict_fate_latest_per_pr EVENTS_JSON [REPO_PREFIX]
# Given a fleet event array (`fleet_logs`' own shape — one JSON object per
# line, already parsed into an array), reduce every `approver-verdict` event
# to the single latest (by `ts`) per `pr_url`, restricted to those whose
# posted review actually reached GitHub (`posted` true, defaulting to true
# for an event logged before that field existed — the best available
# assumption for history this file cannot re-observe) and whose mapped
# `posted_review` is non-empty. REPO_PREFIX, when given, additionally
# restricts to pull requests whose `pr_url` starts with
# `https://github.com/<REPO_PREFIX>/pull/` (case-insensitive), the same
# exact-prefix match `scripts/autonomy-stage-report.sh`'s own
# `crit_agent_approved_prs` already uses so a same-prefix decoy repo is never
# counted. `repo` is always derived from `pr_url` rather than read off the
# event's own `repo` field (docs/spec/implementation/requirements requirement
# 33), so a pre-agent-ops#573 event carrying no `repo` at all reads the same
# as a current one.
#
# Also carries `first_approve_ts` — the earliest `ts` among every surviving
# `approver-verdict` for this pull request whose own posted review was
# `APPROVE`, empty when there was none. A pull request can be approved,
# re-reviewed, and approved again (`review-feedback` is this pipeline's own
# way of bringing one back round after a human requests changes), and the
# *first* approval is what a standing human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` must be
# compared against — testing against the latest verdict's own `ts` would put
# an earlier human review "before" it and hide the divergence entirely
# (agent-ops#661). `verdict_fate_classify` is the reader.
#
# Prints a JSON array of `{pr_url, repo, tier, model, adjudication, verdict,
# posted_review, ts, first_approve_ts}`, oldest-verdict information already
# collapsed away — this is "one entry per pull request" (agent-ops#573).

#   ARMED          `true`/`false` — whether a `landing-armed` event exists for

#                  `crit_autonomous_landings` already performs).
#   PR_STATE       `open`, `closed` or `merged` (GitHub's own three states;
#                  case-insensitive).
#   REVIEWS_JSON   array of `{login, state, submitted_at, bot}` — every review
#                  ever submitted on the pull request, *not* reduced to each
#                  reviewer's standing position. A `CHANGES_REQUESTED` the
#                  same human later replaced with an `APPROVED` still counts
#                  here, deliberately: a divergence that happened is one this
#                  record states, however it was later resolved. That is
#                  where this differs from `_handoff_latest_reviews`'
#                  group-by-login-take-last rule (lib/handoff.sh), which

#                  this pull request right now" — the one the landing gate
#                  asks.
#   FIRST_APPROVE_TS  the earliest `ts` (ISO 8601) among every `approver-verdict`
#                  for this pull request whose posted review was `APPROVE`
#                  (`verdict_fate_latest_per_pr`'s own `first_approve_ts`) —
#                  never the latest verdict's own `ts`. A pull request
#                  approved at T0, sent a standing human `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
#                  at T1, and re-approved at T2 after a `review-feedback`
#                  round must still record that divergence: testing the
#                  window against T2 would put T1 "before" it and silently
#                  drop the signal this file exists to keep (agent-ops#661).
#                  Empty when no verdict for this pull request was ever
