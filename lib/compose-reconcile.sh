# lib/compose-reconcile.sh — apply this node's own merged compose.yaml, the
# way watchtower applies a merged image.
#
# lib/compose-drift.sh answers "has this node's compose.yaml fallen behind the
# copy its image shipped". It has been answering "yes" on nodes for days at a
# time, because the only thing that could act on the answer was a human
# running `docker compose up -d` on that host: an image roll recreates a
# container from the *old* container's Config, so labels, service environment,
# mounts and whole new services merged to `main` sit inert on every node until
# someone visits it. Two escalations in one week (agent-ops#1266's
# `memory.high` parent, agent-ops#1339's collector change) existed only to ask
# the owner to perform that visit.
#
# This library is the deterministic actor the badge never had. No model is in
# this path and none can be: the file it installs is the one that arrived
# through the image, byte for byte, and the only decision taken here is
# whether now is a safe moment to install it.
#
# What it will do, and nothing else:
#
#   1. compare the node's own compose.yaml against the image's copy, through
#      lib/compose-drift.sh — the same comparison the heartbeat badge makes,
#      so the actor and the alarm can never disagree about what drift is;
#   2. check every `${VAR}` the *new* file requires against the keys in the
#      node's `.env`, and refuse outright if one is missing;
#   3. honour the cycle lock and the roll-pending marker exactly as
#      deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh does, so a compose recreate can
#      no more kill a running cycle than an image roll can;
#   4. copy the image's copy over the node's, and run
#      `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans` for that project.
#
# It never touches `.env`. That file holds the node's identity and its live
# credentials, it is the one file that legitimately differs between two nodes,
# and it is the owner's. The env check reads *key names only* — the
# `sed` below discards everything after the `=` before anything is printed —
# so no value is read into a variable, logged, or compared; the same idea the
# workstation's own `env-key-hash.sh` uses to compare a node's `.env` against
# its running containers without ever handling what is in it.
#
# **The copy is written in place, not renamed.** A bind mount of a *file*
# pins the inode it was created against, so `mv`-ing a new file over
# compose.yaml would leave every already-running container's
# `/host/compose.yaml` showing the old content — and `compose up -d` recreates
# only the services whose own config changed, so a node that took a merged
# change adding one new service would go on reporting `compose drifted` from
# every container the change did not touch, for ever, with nothing left to
# reconcile. Truncating the existing inode instead makes the new content
# visible through every existing mount the moment it lands. The write is
# staged beside the target and verified byte-for-byte first, so the
# non-atomic step is a single local copy of an already-checked file.
#
# Verdicts, one compact JSON object, written to `$state_dir/.compose-
# reconcile.json` and carried to every dashboard in this node's heartbeat
# (IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC requirement 2.5a):
#
#   {status:"in-sync", at}                  nothing to do
#   {status:"reconciled", at, from, to}     the file was replaced and the
#                                           project recreated; `from`/`to` are
#                                           the SHA-256 of the old and new file
#   {status:"deferred", at, reason}         a cycle is in flight, or the
#                                           recreate itself failed — retried on
#                                           the next tick either way
#   {status:"refused", at, reason}          the node is not configured for
#                                           reconciliation, or the new file
#                                           needs a `${VAR}` its `.env` does
#                                           not define. Nothing was applied.
#
# A failed `docker compose up -d` is `deferred` rather than `refused` because
# it is retried: the file has already been replaced by then, so drift alone
# would never ask again — `pending_apply` on the marker is what makes the next
# tick retry the recreate it could not finish, and it is the one piece of
# state this library keeps across ticks.
#
# Events reach `$state_dir/log.jsonl` through lib/log-event.sh's envelope, and
# only on a *transition*: this runs every few minutes, and a node that defers
# through a 40-minute cycle must leave one record of the deferral, not eight.
#
# Every path override exists for the tests, which must control all of them and
# must never reach a real Docker socket: COMPOSE_RECONCILE_PROJECT_DIR,
# _IMAGE_FILE, _STATE_DIR, _CONFIG, _DOCKER (the `docker` command itself,
# stubbed), _NOW.
