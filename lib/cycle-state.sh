# lib/cycle-state.sh — how a cycle reports that an item cannot proceed, and
# reads back which items a Co-Ordinator must skip and which the Enabler may
# re-examine.
#
# Sourced by both agent-cycle.sh and scripts/publish-dashboard.sh so the
# semantics of requirements 34, 34c and 35a have exactly one definition — what
# the dashboard reports is then, by construction, what the Co-Ordinator is told
# — and can be regression-tested directly (test/cycle-state.test.sh,
# test/enabler-eligibility.test.sh).
#
# Two states, deliberately distinct (requirement 34c):
#
#   blocked — the work is real but something is in the way *for now* (a red
#             check, an unmerged dependency, a decision nobody has taken). The
#             Co-Ordinator is expected to re-check it and clear it (`unblocked`)
#             once the impediment is demonstrably gone.
#   void    — there is no work: the work order's premise is false, almost always
#             because the item is already done on default_branch. Nothing is in
#             the way, so there is nothing that can "become unblocked" — and the
#             evidence that would tempt an agent to clear it (the work *is*
#             done) is precisely the reason it must stay shut.
#
# Collapsing the two is not a hypothetical. It shipped: an already-done review
# recommendation was recorded as `blocked`, and the next Co-Ordinator, following
# its standing instruction to clear blockers that have gone away, saw the work
# was done, concluded nothing blocked it, and logged `unblocked` — freeing the
# item to be selected and rediscovered forever. Only a human (`unvoided`, hand-
# appended) may clear a void; no agent may.
#
# On top of those two states sits one *derived set* (requirement 35a): the
# blocked items the Enabler may re-examine. It is not a third state — no event
# sets it and none clears it — but a question asked of the whole log at once:
# which blocked, non-void items have sat long enough, or changed enough, that
# one expensive re-examination is worth buying. It belongs here for the reason
# the other two do (requirement 34a): the Script decides an engagement from it
# and the dashboard reports what came of one, and a rule that decides when to
# spend money would drift, in a second copy, in the direction of spending it.
#
# And one *carry-forward* (requirement 3h): the refinements. When the Enabler
# specifies an under-specified item that has no thread to write into, the spec
# it produced lives only in the log, and `refinements_map` is what puts it back
# in front of the Co-Ordinator that will next select the item. Same log, same
# keying, same tolerance of a torn line.

# read_pr_url_breadcrumb CLONE_DIR
# Print the PR URL the Implementer left under .git/ the moment it opened its
# draft PR, or nothing if it never got that far.
#
# The fallback for when a stage exits without ever producing a final message
# (so there's nothing to grep or parse): a stranded attempt can still be found
# and flagged instead of going silent.
#
# Not the last fallback, and not a reliable one: writing this file is a step in
# the Implementer's own procedure, so a stage that skipped its final message
# may equally have skipped this — and on 2026-08-03 three did. What requirement
# 9 falls back to when this comes up empty is `pr_url_for_branch`
# (lib/handoff.sh), which asks GitHub about the branch the *Script* pushed and
# so needs nothing from the stage that failed.
#
# Always succeeds. The callers are `[[ -z "$url" ]] && url="$(read_pr_url_breadcrumb …)"`,

# that agree until the day it matters (the drift TD26071401 fixed for limit
# detection, and requirement 34a makes general).
#
# Events carrying no item are dropped rather than grouped under a shared empty
# key: they pin nothing, and collapsing them together yields one meaningless
# entry that describes no item at all.
#
# State is keyed on repo+item, because an item id is only unique within its

# clears nothing — only `unblocked` does that — so it is folded into the

# member of the set/clear pair `_latest_unresolved` computes. The event is
# repo-scoped (`{item, repo}`, requirement 33), unlike `unblocked`, because
# the two fail in opposite directions: an `unblocked` that over-clears only
# makes an item a candidate again, where a `recheck_clean_ts` folded into an
# unrelated repo's identically-numbered item *raises* that item's comparison
# threshold, so it suppresses a mandated re-read rather than adding one — and
# issue numbers collide across repos far more readily than register ids do.
# Scoping the match makes that fail safe structurally: a marker can only ever
# suppress the one issue its Co-Ordinator actually read.

# **old** — its `ts` at least RETIRE_AFTER_DAYS old — dropped (requirement
# 34n). Everything else, including every entry `_latest_unresolved` groups
# under the same key, passes through unchanged.
#
# This does not change what is void (requirement 34c is untouched, and every
# internal reader that subtracts void from blocked — `open_blocked_items`,
# `enabler_eligible_items`, `refinements_map`, each its own copy of
# `LATEST_UNRESOLVED_JQ` rather than a call to `void_items` — recomputes the
# *raw*, unretired set straight off the log, so a retired item never
# resurfaces as blocked). It only shrinks the *extract* a caller goes on to
# hand to the Co-Ordinator, the no-op fingerprint, or the Refiner's candidate
# filter — the value requirement 4g moved onto stdin after it crossed
# `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` at 122 entries on 2026-08-12, and which keeps growing by
# one entry for every item ever voided if nothing ever retires. ACTIONED_JSON
# is the caller's business, not this function's: `void_object_closed_items`
# (requirement 34k, an issue or pull request GitHub confirms closed) and a
# register row read `resolved` or `not-debt` (requirement 34i's own "gone"
# statuses, checked for the void set the same way that requirement already
# checks it for the blocked one) are both `{repo, item}` pairs, so the caller
# simply concatenates them.
#
# A void naming no repo — the hand-appended form requirement 34c allows —
# never matches an ACTIONED_JSON entry (every actioned pair names a repo) and
# so is never retired; a human's own line is left for a human to retract.
#
# Fails safe in every direction an unattended cycle can hit: RETIRE_AFTER_DAYS
# 0 (or not a non-negative integer) disables retirement outright and returns
# VOID_JSON verbatim, unparseable input (either JSON argument, or a `ts` that
# does not parse as ISO-8601) counts as "not old" rather than erroring the
# entry away, and a jq failure of any kind returns VOID_JSON unchanged. Never
# retiring is always the safe direction here — the failure mode is one more
# cycle carrying an entry that was ready to go, not a void quietly reopened.
#
# This function only *decides*; the caller records each entry it dropped as a
# `void-retired` event, and it is the recorded set (`void_retired_items`,
# subtracted by `subtract_retired_voids` above) that keeps an id from being

# Enabler's `void` verdict, which is its ordinary way of retiring work that
# turned out to be already done, leaves the last `attempt-failed` standing for
# ever. Nothing re-examines such an item and nothing selects it: it is finished

# further Refiner decline (requirement 39d) saying the specification it names
# was tried and found wanting. Comparing timestamps rather than existence alone
# is what lets the item be refined again afterwards: a later `item-refined`
# clears an older block exactly the way `unblocked` already does, and this rule
# must not re-shadow that recovery.

# (`$re`, bound to `REFINEMENT_COMMENT_URL_RE` by the caller), the shape logged
# before the recording seam validated it (TD-PPagop-26082819) — is skipped
# exactly as `ENABLER_ELIGIBLE_JQ`'s `refined_before` derivation already skips
# it, and the latest event that does pass the shape check is used instead.

# nothing on the log's own terms could ever repair (the 2026-09-04 outage).

# the Refiner owes it a genuine specification, and the entry leaves the no-op
# fingerprint's refinements projection so the change wakes the fleet on its

# The tactical decisions a later Refiner engagement must be given (agent-ops

# specification, so an item can carry a decision with no refinement at all
# (the ordinary shape for a `decide-tactical` pass over an item that was never
# refined), and the Refiner still has to turn that decision into an actual
# specification the way it would from a human's own answer on a closed
# escalation. Latest `decision-taken` event per repo+item, dropped once the
# item is void (a decision about work that does not exist is worse than none,
# the same reasoning `REFINEMENTS_MAP_JQ` gives its own void drop) or once a
# refinement genuinely carries the decision forward: an `item-refined` whose
# own `ts` postdates the decision *and* that is not itself marked `unchanged:
# true`. That marker (agent-ops#1049) is what makes the distinction: the
# settle/decide path in lib/enabler.sh re-records `item-refined` whenever a
# prior refinement existed, but that re-record always carries `refined_before`
# verbatim and always postdates the `decision-taken` it sits beside — it is
# never the Refiner turning the decision into an actual specification, only
# the Enabler preserving `refinements_map`'s own entry (requirement 34e). A
# marked re-record therefore does *not* mean the decision's job is done, and
# is excluded here; only an unmarked `item-refined` — the Refiner's own
# fresh-spec write (lib/refinement.sh) — supersedes a decision. A refined
# non-issue item with a decision still pending stays a candidate despite
# `refinements_map` showing it refined (`refiner_candidate_items`,

#
# A `decision-vetoed` event postdating the decision drops it too
# (agent-ops#937, agent-ops#1198): reopening the log issue withdraws the
# decision it logged, and a Refiner engagement the veto's own re-block leads
# to must not be handed the very decision the owner just vetoed as though it
# still stood. `decision-vetoed`'s own `item` names the *original* work item
# (never the log issue's own number — that is `decision_vetoes_processed_items`'

# The Enabler's eligibility rule (requirement 35a), as one jq program over the

# re-deriving any of them: the set it computes is a subset of `open_blocked_items`
# — blocked and not void — and a second opinion about which items those are is
# exactly the drift requirement 34a exists to prevent.
#
# An item is eligible iff all of:
#
#   1. it is blocked — call that latest attempt-failed event B — and
#   2. it is not void: an item with no work needs no unblocking, and the
#      blocked∩void shape every `void` verdict creates (requirement 34h) must
#      not be re-examined at Opus prices. Both clauses are `open_blocked_items`;
#   3. no escalation issue for it is still open — the human has been asked and
#      has not answered yet, so there is nothing new to read. When the repo's
#      issue digest is missing (its source state could not be sampled) we
#      cannot tell, and "cannot tell" resolves to ineligible: the cheap
#      mistake is a delayed engagement, not a duplicate issue;
#   4. one of three reasons applies, and the reason travels on the entry so the
#      model knows why it was woken:
#
#      threshold    — nothing has examined it since B, and MIN_COORD_CYCLES
#                     distinct cycles have run a Co-Ordinator (a `stage-end`
#                     for `coordinator` with `exit_code: 0`) since — or
#                     REFINEMENT_MIN_COORD_CYCLES, for a block whose `kind` is
#                     `needs-refinement`. Counting *cycles that actually
#                     selected* rather than wall-clock hours is what makes the
#                     threshold mean "the pipeline has had several honest
#                     chances to clear this itself": a fleet standing down on
#                     a usage limit, or a switch, logs no coordinator
#                     stage-end and so ages nothing.
#      issue-closed — the item's latest escalation is no longer open and no
#                     examination has followed it since it was raised. This
#                     bypasses the threshold deliberately: the human acted, and
#                     the whole protocol promised them that closing the issue
#                     is what re-starts the work (requirement 36a). Ordinarily
#                     that means the escalation was raised after B (the block
#                     it answers is still the current one); but when B is a
#                     `needs-refinement` re-flag whose `refined_before` (the
#                     item's latest `item-refined`) both exists and predates
#                     the escalation, the re-flag disputes the same
#                     specification the escalation was about, so the human's
#                     close answers it too — TD-PPagop-26082901's race, where
#                     a re-flag between the raise and the next Enabler pass
#                     would otherwise strand the close. A re-flag with no
#                     prior refinement is outside this on purpose: the thrash
#                     guard does not bite without one, so `threshold` already
#                     delivers that item its first refinement.
#
#                     "No examination has followed it" tests examination, not
#                     release: an item can leave its block through four other
#                     paths that log no `enabler-examined` —
#                     lib/candidate-gather.sh's `unblocked {by:
#                     "label-removed"}`/`{by: "work-gone"}`/`{by:
#                     "dependency-resolved"}`, and lib/candidate-select.sh's
#                     bare `unblocked` (item only, no repo — the one path
#                     same_item's "empty repo matches any repo" clause exists
#                     for). A close already acted on through one of those
#                     still reads as unconsumed and can grant a fresh
#                     issue-closed engagement on a long-settled close
#                     (TD-PPagop-26082918). Bounded, not a gap: the engagement
#                     it grants logs the enabler-examined that retires the
#                     exemption for good, verifying the closed issue's claim
#                     against reality before releasing anything
#                     (prompts/enabler.md) — one Opus pass per closed
#                     escalation, not a loop. Distinguishing this from a
#                     genuinely stale re-flag needs a key this rule does not
#                     have on its own: the engagement's own enabler-examined
#                     retires the exemption, and a re-escalation from there
#                     records the re-flag's reason key, so agent-ops#936's
#                     shipped per-reason bound (same reason since the last
#                     human touch escalates to a human, plus the
#                     escalation_adjudication_max_passes cap; PR #1049) is
#                     what stops a settled question being re-asked from
#                     there. The one issue-closed grant per human close is
#                     itself uncapped by design (agent-ops#936 §5: "The
#                     issue-closed exemption stays") — exactly the bounded,
#                     disclosed cost the one-Opus-pass-per-closed-escalation
#                     sentence above already states.
#      recheck      — the newest examination of it is older than RECHECK_HOURS
#                     (0 disables). This is the path by which evidence that
#                     arrived after an examination — a diagnosis posted into
#                     the very thread whose absence blocked the item — is
#                     eventually read at all, and the only bound on how long a
#                     permanently-stuck item can sit unexamined.
#
# A re-block after an examination re-enters through `threshold`, because every
# guard above is measured from B: a fresh attempt-failed moves B forward, which
# leaves the old examination behind it and starts the count again — except for
# the `needs-refinement` shape of `issue-closed` just described, which is
# measured from the escalation instead precisely so that re-block does not
# strand an already-closed escalation.
#
# An `enabler-examined` whose outcome is `escalation-failed` is deliberately not
# an examination. The engagement reached a verdict it could not act on, so the
# item is exactly where it was; treating the marker as progress would retire the
# item on the strength of a failed `gh issue create`.
#
# Each entry carries `pr_url` when the blocking event named one (requirement
# 32a). Under that requirement a pull request the Reviewer could not hand off is
# a blocked item like any other, and for a finishing source the item id names a
# register entry rather than the PR — so without this the Enabler would have to
# re-derive from the id the very artefact the block is about. Empty when the
# block had no PR, which is most of them.
#
# Two more fields carry the refinement class (requirements 34e, 36b). `kind` is
# the block's own marker, so an engagement can tell an under-specified item from
# an impeded one and knows which duty it is there to perform; it is `""` for
# every ordinary block, which is what keeps this class invisible to the rest of
# the rule. `refined_before` is the latest `item-refined` for the same repo+item
# — the thrash guard's input, and the record of what the last engagement already
# said, so a second one need not guess at it.
#
# TD-PPagop-26082819: an `item-refined` event whose `comment_url` does not
# actually name a comment — logged before the recording seam
# (`refinement_record_fields`, `lib/refinement.sh`) validated its shape, the
# same phantom shape #818's and #874's events both carried — is skipped here
# rather than trusted, so `$refined` derives to the latest event that really
# is corroborated (or `null`, if none is). `$phantom` is the caller's own
# pre-computed set of such events, over the same `$all` (see
# `enabler_eligible_items`'s own comment on why the check lives there and not
# inline here): every candidate for `$refined` is drawn from the same
# `$all[]` this file already scans, so matching an event against that set —
# rather than re-testing the URL's shape a second time in this jq program —
# keeps `refinement_comment_url_valid` (`lib/refinement.sh`) the one place
# that predicate is evaluated, on the same "one predicate, one rule" terms
# TD-PPagop-26082603 asks for.
#
# The match is on the whole `{repo, item, ts}` triple, never `ts` alone.
# `log_event` (`agent-cycle.sh`) stamps whole-second UTC timestamps and this
# runs over the fleet-wide *union* log, so two `item-refined` events sharing
# a second across different items is ordinary traffic — keying on `ts` alone
# would let one item's phantom suppress another item's genuine refinement,
# silently disarming requirement 36b's thrash guard for an item that really
# was refined and discarding the `spec`/`comment_url` `lib/enabler.sh`'s
# adjudication path reads back out of `refined_before`.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016  # jq's $ vars ($all/$b/$open/$phantom/…), not the shell's.

# $all and $phantom are bound by the caller, via `input as $all`/`input as
# $phantom` (requirement 4g) — never a leading `. as $all` here, since the
# caller runs this body with `jq -n`.
#
# The `issue-closed` branch's own timestamp guard reads `$escalation.ts >=
# $b.ts`, not strictly `>` (agent-ops#937, agent-ops#1198): an ordinary
# escalation is filed cycles after the block it answers, so the two never
# tie, but the decision-veto sweep (`lib/decision-veto.sh`) logs its
# `escalated` registration in the very same pass — and often the very same
# wall-clock second — as the `needs-refinement` block it re-blocks the item
# with, since both describe the same veto discovered in the same cycle.
# `log_event` (`agent-cycle.sh`) stamps whole-second timestamps, so a strict
# `>` would coin-flip that tie and strand the veto's own release the way
# #1198 named. Widening to `>=` costs nothing on the ordinary path — the two
# events there are never this close — and is exactly what makes the veto's
# escalation registration observe the same "closing it releases the item"
# contract an ordinary escalation already gets.
