# lib/crash-loop.sh — detect a fleet-wide crash loop in the union log, and
# decide whether it has already been escalated (requirement 2.7).
#
# The failure class this first existed for is the one the fleet has actually
# lived through: a deterministic Co-Ordinator failure that ships in the
# image, so a single roll breaks every node identically. On 2026-08-01 the
# assembled Co-Ordinator prompt crossed the kernel's argv cap and every node
# in the fleet exited 126 hourly for ~15 hours — and the record made it look
# like a healthy idle fleet, because a Co-Ordinator failure pins no repo/item
# (so nothing was blocked, and the Enabler had nothing to examine) and the
# cycle still ends 0. Item-scoped failures already have a whole recovery
# ladder (blocked → Enabler → escalation issue); the Co-Ordinator's own
# failures had no rung at all. This is that rung.
#
# `crash_loop_verdict`'s detection is deliberately narrow: *consecutive*
# Co-Ordinator `attempt-failed` events carrying *one identical* detail, with
# no Co-Ordinator success for that same repository anywhere in the fleet in
# between. Identical detail is what separates the deterministic class (every
# node says `coordinator exited 126`) from ordinary transient noise (one
# timeout here, one unparseable message there), and any same-repository
# Co-Ordinator success resets that repository's own count to zero — a
# repository that is mostly working is not in a crash loop, however many
# failures it accumulates over a week.
#
# Since issue #587 split Co-Ordinator selection into one engagement per
# configured repository, each engagement's own `attempt-failed`/`stage-end`
# events carry that repository's own `repo` field (the `{repo: <slug>}`
# `extra` merge `run_coordinator_stage_attempt` and `handle_stage_failure`
# both make, lib/stage-attempt.sh). `crash_loop_verdict` runs its reduction
# independently *per repository*, grouped by that field, so one repository's
# own deterministic failure accumulates its own consecutive count instead of
# being reset every cycle by a sibling repository's success (agent-ops#1630)
# — the gap left when issue #587 first split selection but deliberately left
# this detector fleet-wide (`run_coordinator_stage_attempt`'s own comment,
# "rather than splitting further in the same change that split selection
# itself"). An event carrying no `repo` at all — history from before #587, or
# any future Co-Ordinator caller that legitimately has none — falls back into
# its own group, reduced exactly as the whole stream used to be: fleet-wide,
# resetting on any repo-less success. That fallback group is independent of
# every real repository's own group; a repo-less success never resets a
# repository-scoped run, and a repository-scoped success never resets the
# fallback group.
#
# `crash_loop_preselection_verdict` (TD-PPagop-26081302) covers the class the
# first reader cannot see: a cycle that dies while assembling its own runtime
# input, before `stage-start` for any stage is ever logged, writes no
# `attempt-failed` at all — the 2026-08-12 void-extract outage took exactly
# this shape, crossing the same argv cap before requirement 4g's stdin fix
# landed. It groups consecutive cycle-start/cycle-end(non-zero)/no-stage-start
# runs by `exit_code`, the cheapest fingerprint this class leaves in place of
# a `detail` string.
#
# All functions are pure readers of an event stream on stdin — the same
# union the stand-down checks read, so a loop any node detects is one every
# node agrees about. Torn lines are skipped (`fromjson? // empty`), exactly
# as the dashboard's reader treats the same stream.

# crash_loop_verdict THRESHOLD < union.jsonl
# Print one JSON object per line (JSON Lines) — {stage, detail, count,
# first_ts, last_ts, nodes, escalate, repo?} — one line for every repository
# (plus the repo-less fallback group) whose own tail independently shows
# THRESHOLD or more consecutive same-detail Co-Ordinator failures with no
# intervening same-repository Co-Ordinator success; print nothing when no
# group reaches THRESHOLD. `repo` is present iff the group's own events
# carried one — the repo-less fallback group's object omits it, exactly as
# every verdict object did before repositories were grouped, so a caller that
# only ever fed this a repo-less stream sees byte-identical output. Multiple
# lines mean multiple repositories are independently crash-looping in the
# same cycle; each is a separate, independently-escalatable run. A THRESHOLD
# that is not a positive integer prints nothing: 0 (or an unset key upstream)
# is the feature's off switch.
#
# `escalate` (issue #1073) is `false` exactly when every failure counted in
# that group's own run carries `api_refusal_class: "transient"` on its own
# event — the API was unreachable, not refusing the request, and no amount of
# retrying inside this repository clears that. It is `true` otherwise: a run
# with no class at all (a crash, a timeout, an unparseable message — nothing
# `stage_api_refusal` ever classified) defaults to escalating exactly as it
# always has, and one `refused` failure anywhere in that group's own run is
# enough to call the whole run escalate-worthy, on the theory that a mixed
# run is evidence of *something* deterministic even if not every member
# proves it alone. The run is still counted and still resets on a
# same-repository success either way — `escalate` only changes what the
# caller does with a verdict that already fired, never whether one fires.

# Print one JSON object — {stage, detail, exit_code, count, first_ts,

# consecutive cycles that each died before any stage started, with the same
# exit code and no intervening recovery; print nothing otherwise. Same
# THRESHOLD off switch as `crash_loop_verdict`.
#
# This covers the class `crash_loop_verdict` cannot see: a cycle that dies
# while assembling its own runtime input — before `stage-start` for any
# stage is ever logged — writes no `attempt-failed` for any stage, so the
# union shows only a `cycle-start` / `cycle-end(<nonzero>)` pair. Both the
# 2026-08-01 argv-cap outage and the 2026-08-12 void-extract one took this
# shape: `execve` failed before the Co-Ordinator process ever started, so
# nothing pinned `stage: coordinator` on anything.
#
# There is no `detail` string for this class the way an `attempt-failed`
# carries one, so cycles are grouped by `exit_code` instead — the cheapest
# fingerprint a pre-selection death leaves. A cycle is joined to a run by
# matching `cycle` id across its `cycle-start`, any `stage-start`s, and its
# `cycle-end`; cycles with no `cycle-end` at all (still running, or killed
# too abruptly to log one) are dropped rather than counted either way. A
# cycle resets the run — exactly like a Co-Ordinator success resets
# `crash_loop_verdict` — the moment it proves the systemic block is not
# reproducing right now: either it exits 0, or it starts a selection-path
# stage (`coordinator`, `implementer` or `reviewer`), regardless of how
# that stage then fares. What happens to an item once a stage is running
# already has its own recovery ladder; this reader's only job is the gap
# before that ladder can even see a failure.
#
# The stage list is deliberately a whitelist of the stages that can only
# start once the cycle's runtime input has been assembled — the phase whose
# death this reader exists to see. The Enabler and the Refiner start from
# `cleanup()`, *after* any pre-selection death has already happened and
# before `cycle-end` is logged, so a `stage-start` from either proves the
# post-mortem path ran, not that selection got anywhere. Today both decline
# on a non-zero cycle exit, but that guard is framed as a cost decision and
# may one day be relaxed — and this reader must not silently stop firing
# when it is. An unlisted future selection-path stage fails the other way,
# as a spurious verdict a human sees and corrects: the right failure mode
# for an alarm.
