# lib/noop-skip.sh — the no-op short-circuit (requirement 3b): deciding whether
# engaging the Co-Ordinator could possibly produce a different answer than the
# last time it found nothing to do.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh and scripts/publish-dashboard.sh, so the rule and
# what the dashboard reports about it are one definition (requirement 34a).
#
# ## What this claims, and what it does not
#
# The Co-Ordinator is a pure function of its inputs, give or take model
# variance. If none of those inputs has moved since it last returned
# `{"selected": false}`, running it again buys the same answer at the same
# price. On an idle repository that is 24 answers a day, every day, none of
# which does anything.
#
# So the claim this rule makes is deliberately narrow:
#
#     Every input to the Co-Ordinator's verdict is byte-identical to when it
#     last declined, therefore its verdict would be the same.
#
# It is *not* the claim "there is no work". Nobody here can know that — only
# the Co-Ordinator can, and this rule exists precisely to avoid asking it. The
# distinction is what makes the rule safe: it never has to be right about the
# repository, only about whether anything changed.
#
# ## The fingerprint must cover every input, or the pipeline silently stalls
#
# This is the dangerous half. A source left out of the fingerprint is a source
# that can gain work without waking the pipeline, and the symptom is nothing at
# all: no error, no alert, just PRs that stop appearing while the log fills
# with tidy `stand-down` events saying everything is fine. That is this
# system's signature failure (see the Gotchas table) and this rule is an
# excellent way to build a new one.

#
# `review_feedback` is hashed verbatim, like `findings`, and that gets the rule
# right for free in both directions: its entries only exist while it is the
# agent's turn to answer a review (see scripts/gather-review-feedback.sh), so a
# new review round adds one, and the agent's own push removes it. The
# alternative — digesting the PR's `reviewDecision` — would be stably
# CHANGES_REQUESTED before *and* after the fix, because the agent cannot dismiss
# a review on its own PR.
#
# `abandoned_drafts` is hashed verbatim for a sharper reason: it is one of two
# candidate rules that turn on something *no event on the PR itself carries*. A
# draft PR becomes abandoned merely by sitting untouched past the threshold, which
# moves no commit, issue, alert or even the PR's own `updated_at` — so the
# `open_prs` digest alone would sit unchanged across the exact moment the work
# appears, and the pipeline would skip it until the forced recheck.
# gather-abandoned-drafts.sh computes candidacy against the clock and this array
# carries the result, so a draft crossing the threshold *adds an entry* and busts
# the fingerprint the cycle it goes stale. Without this line the whole source is a
# silent stall waiting to happen.
#
# `merge_conflicts` is hashed verbatim for the same class of reason. A ready PR
# turns CONFLICTING when its *base* advances — someone merges another PR to `main`
# — which is not an event on this PR: its head does not move and its `updated_at`
# does not change, so the `open_prs` digest (which keys on number, updated_at,
# head ref and draft flag) does not move for it. Worse, the base advance and the
# conflict appearing are two separate cycles: the cycle the base moves, the repo's
# head SHA changes and busts the fingerprint, but GitHub has not yet recomputed
# mergeability (`UNKNOWN`), so nothing is gathered; a later cycle mergeability
# resolves to CONFLICTING with the repo head SHA unchanged since — so without this
# array the fingerprint would match the earlier none-selected and skip the very
# cycle the work becomes visible. gather-merge-conflicts.sh samples mergeability
# and this array carries the result, so the flip to CONFLICTING *adds an entry*
# and busts the fingerprint. Same failure shape as abandoned-drafts; same fix.
#
# `dequeued` (TD-PPagop-26081409) is hashed verbatim for an even sharper version
# of the same reason. A merge-group checks-failure dequeue moves *nothing* the
# `open_prs` digest samples — not the head (no commit lands), not `updated_at`
# (GitHub does not touch it), not even `mergeable`, which is what merge_conflicts
# above rides on. The only trace is a `RemovedFromMergeQueueEvent` on the pull
# request's own timeline, read live each cycle by `lib/merge-queue.sh`'s
# `merge_queue_probe` — a fact that exists nowhere else in this system's state.
# gather-dequeued.sh samples that probe and this array carries the result, so a
# fresh dequeue *adds an entry* and busts the fingerprint, and a re-queue that
# resolves it removes the entry the same way. Same failure shape as
# merge_conflicts and abandoned_drafts; same fix.
#
# A *fix* removes the entry too, but by a different route worth knowing here,
# because it is the one case where this array's churn is not the signal it looks
# like: the dequeue itself never clears (the timeline event is permanent), so
# what drops the pull request is gather-dequeued.sh's answered clause noticing
# the Implementer's marked reply. Until that clause was added, a fix merely
# re-keyed the entry to the new head SHA — busting this fingerprint on every
# round while nothing had actually changed, which is precisely the wake-up this
# file exists to avoid paying for twice.
#
# `landing_refusals` (requirement 53, issue #979) is hashed verbatim for the
# same class of reason as `dequeued`: gate 4's own refusal
# (`_landing_stage_attempt`, `lib/landing.sh`) moves nothing the `open_prs`
# digest samples — no commit lands, `updated_at` does not move, and the
# refusal itself lives only in the fleet-wide union log, a fact no digest
# above reads at all. gather-landing-refusals.sh's own live re-check
# (`reconciliation_unreconciled_comments`) is what makes the array's presence
# or absence track the true state — a fresh refusal *adds* an entry (scoped to
# the unreconciled comment ids, so a new comment or a reply that clears one
# also changes the entry) and busts the fingerprint the cycle it appears;
# leaving this source out of the fingerprint would be the exact silent stall
# this file's own header warns about, for the one source whose entire purpose
# is giving a refusal a route back to work.
#
# `claimed` (requirement 3o) is hashed too, projected to `repo|item` like
# `blocked`/`void`, for the same class of gap `abandoned_drafts` and
# `merge_conflicts` close: a peer node claiming an item — winning a branch
# create-ref, or writing a registry entry for a file claim — moves no commit,
# issue, alert, or (until its PR exists) the `open_prs` digest above. Without
# this line a claim appearing or a claim ageing past `claim_ttl_hours` (both
# add or remove an entry) could sit unnoticed behind a matching fingerprint
# until the forced recheck, which is exactly the silent-stall shape this rule
# exists to close — and the reason `claimed` was introduced in the first
# place (issue #175) was to stop the model's own live check from being the
# only thing that ever noticed a peer's claim.
#
# `human_visibility` is hashed verbatim for the same class of reason
# `abandoned_drafts` and `merge_conflicts` are (requirement 38e): a violation
# becomes live re-checkable candidacy off a `warning` event
# scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh already logged, which moves no commit,
# issue, alert or open-PR digest field of its own — and the live re-check
# scripts/gather-human-visibility-hygiene.sh performs (a merged, closed or
# now-reviewed pull request drops it) is itself a transition nothing else
# here samples. Without this line a violation appearing, or quietly
# resolving, would sit unnoticed behind a matching fingerprint until the
# forced recheck.
#
# `tech_debt` (requirement 3t, issue #310) is hashed verbatim for a weaker
# but still real reason: as a GitHub issue, an item's state changes only via
# a live `gh` read, which no other signal here samples. It is hashed anyway
# for uniformity, and because this array is what
# lets requirement 3t's machine corroboration compare the Co-Ordinator's verdict
# against the Script's own eligible count — a fingerprint that dropped this
# array could match an old none-selected event from before a blocked or void
# item's exclusion changed which items were even offered.
#
# `issues` (the pre-fetched array of requirement 3j) is hashed verbatim, and
# it is the only cover for one real transition: an *edit* to an existing
# comment. GitHub moves the issue's `updated_at` for a new comment, a label, a
# title edit or an assignment — the digest sees all of those — but editing a
# comment in place moves only the comment's own timestamp, which the digest
# does not sample. The Co-Ordinator reads the thread verbatim from this array,
# so a re-scoped instruction edited into an old comment changes its verdict
# while every digest field sits still; only the array's bytes carry it. The
# `state.issues` digest stays alongside rather than being retired: it is
# sampled independently of the array (see gather-source-state.sh on why its
# failure mode must differ), so a cycle whose issues fetch degraded to `[]`
# still gets its fingerprint busted by the digest when a real issue moves.
#
# `enabler_eligible` is hashed for the same class of reason again (requirement
# 35b). An item becomes eligible for the Enabler when the fleet has run its
# third Co-Ordinator since the block — which moves no commit, issue, alert or
# PR — so without this line a quiet fleet would skip straight through the cycle
# the escalation became due and go on skipping until the forced recheck. The
# projection keeps the `reason` alongside `repo|item`, which is what carries the
# transition that matters most: an escalation issue the human closes takes the
# entry from ineligible to `issue-closed`, and closing the issue is the entire
# protocol that issue asked of them. After an engagement the examined markers
# empty the set again and skipping resumes — the same shape as a stalled draft
# being finished.
#
# `refinements` is hashed because a refinement the Enabler wrote is an input to
# the Co-Ordinator's next verdict (requirement 3h) — it is the whole of what a
# non-issue item's work order will say. In practice an `item-refined` event
# always travels with the `unblocked` that returns the item to the pool, so the
# `blocked` projection above would bust the fingerprint anyway; it is listed
# separately rather than left to that coincidence, because "covered by something
# else" is how a source ends up covered by nothing.
#
# `enabler_config` and `enabler_prompt_sha` are the Enabler's half of the two
# lines below, with one deliberate difference in what they buy: editing
# prompts/enabler.md busts the fingerprint, so a quiet fleet notices the edit,
# but it does not re-open items already examined — those are gated by
# `enabler_recheck_hours`, which is the lever for "read this one again".
#
# `coordinator_work_sources_table` is hashed verbatim, and it is not the same
# claim as `repos[].sources` above (issue #78). That array is `ordered_repos_
# json`'s view, which back-pressure (requirement 2.2a) narrows to just the
# four finishing sources for a repo with work waiting; the table the
# Co-Ordinator actually reads is always rendered from the plain, unrestricted
# `config.json` (`lib/coordinator-brief.sh`), because the table's own job is
# to show each repo's full configured priority regardless of this cycle's
# restrictions. During a back-pressure cycle those two views diverge by
# construction, so a config edit to a non-finishing source would bust neither
# `repos[].sources` nor (being config, not a commit) `coordinator_prompt_sha`
# — only this line carries it, and without it such an edit would sit
# unnoticed until back-pressure lifted.
#
# The last three are easy to forget and cost the most when forgotten: without
# them, editing prompts/coordinator.md, adding a source to config.json, or
# reordering one during a back-pressure cycle would have no effect until
# something unrelated happened to change in a repo. You would be debugging
# your edit, and your edit would be fine.
#
# ## Where a fingerprint match is judged
#
# Against the most recent `none-selected` event carrying a fingerprint, and
# nothing else. There is no need to reason about what happened in between: any
# cycle that selected an item necessarily changed something the fingerprint
# covers (it opens a PR, or blocks the item, or voids it), so a match with an
# older `none-selected` means the Co-Ordinator's world has genuinely returned
# to that state — and returning to a state in which it declined is grounds to
# expect it to decline again.
#
# ## The forced recheck is the safety valve, not a nicety
#
# `none_selected_recheck_hours` bounds how long a fingerprint bug — or a source
# nobody thought of, or a Co-Ordinator that would have decided differently on a
# second look — can hold the pipeline down. Setting it to 0 disables the valve
# and makes fingerprint coverage load-bearing forever. Don't.

# The canonical form the fingerprint is taken over. Emits nothing at all — an
# unfingerprintable cycle — when any repo's source state could not be sampled
# cleanly (`ok: false`), because a digest built from a failed API call is a
# stable lie: it would match the next equally-failed sample and skip cycles for
# as long as the outage lasted (see scripts/gather-source-state.sh).
#
# Arrays are sorted, and blocked/void are projected down to their repo+item
# keys — the Enabler's eligible set to repo+item+reason, since there the reason
# is the change — so that the fingerprint tracks meaning rather than incidental
# order or the timestamps and prose that ride along on a log event. `jq -S` then
# sorts every object key, making the serialisation canonical.
#
# The three `enabler_*` keys, `refinements`, `claimed`, and
# `coordinator_work_sources_table` all default to empty, so an input that
# predates them canonicalises exactly as one that carries them empty:
# replaying an older cycle's input yields its original fingerprint, and a
# node whose config sets no Enabler keys agrees with itself.
# shellcheck disable=SC2016  # jq's syntax, not the shell's.
