# lib/model-id.sh — provider-qualified model identifiers (D12 groundwork,
# docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md requirement 1a).
#
# Every model key in config.json (coordinator_model, implementer_model_*,
# reviewer_model_*, enabler_model, repository_review.defaults.model and its
# per-repo overrides) accepts either a bare model
# id (`claude-sonnet-5`) or one qualified with a provider prefix
# (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`). Anthropic is the only executable provider
# today (decision D12 in docs/ROADMAP.md), so the two forms are the same
# value; a qualifier naming any other provider fails fast here, at config
# read time, rather than reaching `claude --model` mid-cycle.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh and review-cycle.sh.

# resolve_model_id KEY VALUE
# Prints the bare model id `claude --model` expects. An unqualified VALUE
# (including empty, which some keys use to disable a stage) passes through
# unchanged; an `anthropic/`-qualified VALUE has the qualifier stripped. Any
# other qualifier prints a message naming KEY and the offending provider to
# stderr and returns 1 without printing a value.

# Model-tier ordering (agent-ops#822, docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md
# requirement 1c). #815 (fixed by #819) and #821 both trace to the same root
# cause: nothing stopped a cheaper model from authoring a work order
# specification a more capable Implementer then executed. This table is what
# makes "cheaper" and "more capable" checkable in code rather than by
# convention — the fleet's four currently configured model ids, ranked by
# capability (confirmed by Anthropic's own relative pricing: haiku < sonnet
# < opus < fable). A model this table has never heard of — a future release,
# a typo the modelId pattern still accepts — ranks unknown rather than lowest
# or highest, and every function below treats "unknown" as "cannot verify",
# never as "fails" or "passes": scripts/doctor.sh warns separately so an
# unranked model is never silently invisible to the checks that use this.

# outright ("bad array subscript"), which under `set -e` aborts the calling
# script instead of returning the 1 this promises. Both callers below already
# screen empties before they get here, but this is shared library code and the
