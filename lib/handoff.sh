# lib/handoff.sh — the moment a pull request stops being the pipeline's and
# reaches the landing gate, made a fact rather than a claim (requirement 31a).
#
# Requirement 31 gives the Reviewer one irreversible action: once CI is green
# and the PR is mergeable, it runs `gh pr ready`. That single call is the whole
# handoff — everything before it is the pipeline talking to itself, and
# everything after it belongs to whoever lands the pull request: a human's
# queue at `merge_autonomy: human`, or the Script's own arming step at
# `agent-merges-routine` and above. Requirement 32 then has the Reviewer
# *report* what it did, and the Script logs `pr-ready` from that report.
#
# Those are two different things, and treating the report as the deed is how a
# finished PR disappears. It happened: a Reviewer answered
# `{"status": "ready", "ci": "passing"}` for a PR whose work was complete and
# whose checks were green, never ran `gh pr ready`, and the Script logged
# `pr-ready` and moved on. The PR stayed a draft — invisible to the human, who
# is watching for review requests, and invisible to the log, which recorded a
# successful handoff. Three hours later the abandoned-drafts source (requirement
# 3e) correctly re-detected it as a stalled draft and paid an Implementer and a
# Reviewer to finish work that was already finished, at a fresh head SHA, which
# is a fresh ref no block covers — so it would have done that on the hour,
# indefinitely, each round looking productive.
#
# What makes this class of bug expensive is that no component is in a position
# to notice it. The Reviewer believes it handed off. The Script believes the
# Reviewer. The log agrees with both. Only GitHub disagrees, and nobody asked
# it. So this file asks it: the verdict stays the Reviewer's — it is the only
# actor that has read the diff — but whether the PR left draft is checked
# against the API, and the check is cheap enough (one field on one PR) to make
# unconditionally.
#
# The Script also *completes* a handoff the Reviewer left undone rather than
# failing it. The expensive, model-shaped half of requirement 31 is the
# judgement "this is ready"; `gh pr ready` is mechanism, and the Script can
# perform mechanism deterministically. Failing instead would put a PR the
# Reviewer has certified in front of a human as a problem, which is the outcome
# requirement 32a exists to avoid.
#
# `pr_url_for_branch` below is the same principle applied one step earlier, and
# it is here rather than beside the other requirement 9 fallbacks for that
# reason: those read what an actor left behind, and this asks GitHub. Nothing
# can be handed off that cannot be named, and the pipeline had three ways to
# name a stranded pull request, all three of which depend on the stage that has
# just failed (see requirement 9).
#
# `confirm_review_requested` is the same promise for the round *after* the
# first. A draft flip is the handoff exactly once per pull request; every
# later round begins with a PR that is already ready, so `gh pr ready` is a
# no-op and there is nothing left that puts the PR back in front of the human.
# See its own comment for what that cost.
#
# `ensure_human_reviewer` is the same promise again, for the case neither of
# the above covers: a ready pull request with nobody's review currently
# blocking it — first-round, or already approved — where the human still has
# not been *asked*, only auto-subscribed by CODEOWNERS and then dropped from
# the queue the moment they answered (requirement 38 in
# docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md).
#
# `handoff_answer_events` and `handoff_round_answered` are a different kind
# of promise again: not an action, but the judgement two callers must agree
# on before either acts — whether a review round is *answered* at all
# (requirement 3c's candidate rule, `scripts/gather-review-feedback.sh`, and
# requirement 38c's sweep, `scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh`). The two used
# to compute this independently — one script had it, the other deliberately
# did not, because a naive second copy would have read the sweep's own past
# re-request as an answer to itself (tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26080804.md). One
# definition, two callers, each passing what it is and is not allowed to
# treat as an answer, is requirement 34a applied to a predicate instead of an
# action.
#
# `handoff_complete_review` is the whole pre-flip sequence — requirement 31c's
# gate, requirement 25a's closing-keyword gate, requirement 25c's
# changelog-section gate (agent-ops#1808, on the closing-keyword gate's own
# pattern), requirement 31c's reconciliation
# gate (agent-ops#533) and its revert-on-refusal (`confirm_pr_draft`,
# agent-ops#539), the draft flip, the re-request, `ensure_human_reviewer` — as
# the one function both the Reviewer's own handoff and the Enabler's
# `complete_handoff` recovery path call (agent-ops#440). The two used to run
# only the flip/re-request/nudge half in common, each with its own inline copy
# of that sequence in agent-cycle.sh; the gate half was never duplicated, it
# was simply never called at all on the Enabler's path, so a `complete_
# handoff` on a pull request whose required checks were red or which carried
# a fresh security-severity code-scanning alert flipped it to ready
# regardless. Sharing one function is also what makes the revert-on-refusal
# fix reach both paths at once: a `dirty` reconciliation verdict left the
# pull request ready rather than reverting it to draft, on either path, until
# agent-ops#539. See its own comment for the fix and for what it does not
# cover (whether a Reviewer verdict is on record at all, which is the
# caller's job — see agent-cycle.sh's own comment at each call site).
#
# Sourced, never executed: it sets no shell options, because agent-cycle.sh
# runs under `set -euo pipefail` and a library that re-sets options silently
# changes its caller.
#
# Environment:
#   HANDOFF_GH  override `gh` (tests stub it).
#   `handoff_answer_events` and `handoff_round_answered` read
#   `PIPELINE_COMMENT_MARKER_PREFIX` — source lib/pipeline-marker.sh before
#   this file, or before calling either.
#   `handoff_complete_review` calls `review_gate_verdict` (lib/review-gate.sh),
#   `closing_keyword_gate` (lib/closing-keyword-gate.sh),
#   `changelog_section_gate` (lib/changelog-section-gate.sh) and
#   `reconciliation_gate` (lib/reconciliation-gate.sh) — source all four
#   before this file, or before calling it.

# pr_url_for_branch TARGET_SLUG BRANCH
# Print the URL of the open pull request whose head is BRANCH in TARGET_SLUG,
# or nothing at all.
#
# The last of requirement 9's fallbacks for a stage that died without saying
# what it had opened, and the only one that does not depend on that stage. The
# other three — the final message's `pr_url`, a URL grepped out of the stage
# output, the `.git/agent-ops-pr-url` breadcrumb (requirement 23) — are all
# things the Implementer must have done something to produce, and an
# Implementer that failed to emit a parseable final message is precisely an
# Implementer that may have skipped them. All three came up empty on three
# items in one hour on 2026-08-03 (agent-ops #172, #173, #175), each with
# finished, pushed, CI-green work in a draft pull request the Script could no
# longer name: no stage-failure comment landed on any of them, and the
# Enabler's one lever for a stalled handoff — `complete_handoff`, gated on a
# non-empty `pr_url` from the block (requirement 32b) — was unavailable for
# exactly the failure it exists to recover. A human finished all three by
# hand.
#
# The branch needs nothing from the model: the Script computed it itself
# (`claim_branch_for`, requirement 17a) and pushed it before the stage began.
# So this is the fallback that holds when the stage contributed nothing at
# all, which is the case worth having one for.
#
# `--state open` is the question actually being asked: a pull request to
# comment on and hand off. `.[0]` because a head branch can in principle carry
# more than one open pull request (differing bases); `gh` lists newest first,
# which is the one this cycle pushed.
#
# Always succeeds, printing nothing when there is no such PR or the API cannot
# be reached — the two are not distinguished, deliberately. Every caller is a
# `[[ -z "$url" ]] && url="$(pr_url_for_branch …)"` on a failure path already
# in progress, under `errexit`, where a non-zero return would kill the cycle
# before it logs the failure this is trying to enrich (the same trap
# `read_pr_url_breadcrumb` documents). Coming up empty costs what the pipeline

# reconciliation verdict with `safe: false` and nothing else — the pull
# request stayed exactly as the Reviewer's own step-7 `gh pr ready` had just
# left it: ready, not draft. That flip is not undone by refusing the handoff,

# on the very next round (see that function's header) — the gate refused
# once and then, having nothing left to refuse *from*, read the identical
# unreconciled comment as reconciled forever after. Reverting the flip here
# is what gives the *next* round's timeline a `convert_to_draft` event to

# _handoff_pr_query SLUG NUMBER

# through it `_handoff_blocking_reviewers`/`_handoff_pr_approved`),
# `_handoff_known_reviewers` and `_handoff_pending_review_targets` each ask
# this one question — `pullRequest(number:){ author, reviews, reviewRequests
# }` — rather than their own REST endpoint. Measured live, 2026-08-31,
# against agent-ops#1059 (five reviews, one pending request): `rateLimit{cost}`
# on the identical selection set reports 1, against what was up to four
# separate REST reads (each caller its own `/pulls/<n>/reviews --paginate` or
# `/pulls/<n>`) in the 48 hours to 2026-08-30, when the REST `core` pool
# logged 95 refusals fleet-wide and `graphql` sat at 1513 of 5000 — the
# lopsidedness this migration exists to correct. Each of the four callers
# still asks fresh when it runs — nothing here memoises across callers, the
# same "ask fresh" discipline `handoff_complete_review`'s own header states
# for its seven callees — so a caller is exactly as current as its REST
# predecessor was, only cheaper and drawn from the pool with headroom.
#
# Prints `{author, reviews: [{login, bot, state, submitted_at}], pending:
# [login-or-slug, …]}`:
#   - `author` is the pull request's author's login, or "" if the account was
#     deleted (GraphQL's `Actor` still resolves, `login` does not).
#   - `reviews` is every review GitHub returns, unfiltered by `submitted_at`
#     (a review still being drafted carries a null one) — left to each caller
#     to filter, exactly as `_handoff_latest_reviews`'s own
#     `select(.submitted_at != null)` did over the REST shape, so that filter
#     stays visible at the call site that relies on it rather than hidden in
#     here. `bot` is true for a `Bot`-typed author or a `[bot]`-suffixed
#     login, the same two-part test the REST-era filter used — GraphQL's own
#     `__typename` is authoritative, but the suffix is kept alongside it
#     rather than dropped, since a caller here has never had to depend on
#     `__typename` alone before.
#   - `pending` is every `reviewRequests` entry whose `requestedReviewer` is
#     not a bot by the same two-part test, named by `login` (`User`/
#     `Mannequin`) or `slug` (`Team`) — an `EnterpriseTeam` requested
#     reviewer, an edge case no caller here has ever had to handle over REST
#     either, is silently excluded exactly as an unrecognised REST `type`
#     would leave it out of `known`.
#
# `reviews(last:100)`/`reviewRequests(first:100)`: a caller only ever wants a
# reviewer's own *latest* standing review or the reviewers currently pending,
# so a review or request more than 100 behind the most recent one survives
# only if nobody has reviewed or been requested since — the same trade
# `merge_queue_probe`'s own `timelineItems(last:5)` already takes, for the
# same reason, and never observed against this fleet's own pull requests.
#
# Returns non-zero, printing nothing, on the same "could not ask" terms as
# `_handoff_draft_flag` — bad arguments, an unreachable API, a deleted pull
# request, an authentication failure. stderr is left to flow to whatever the
# caller redirects: `_handoff_pr_author`, `_handoff_latest_reviews` and
# `_handoff_known_reviewers` discard it (they have nothing to classify a
# failure by), while `_handoff_pending_review_targets` captures it to tell a

#
# Bot filtering is deliberately not a parameter here: it is a property of
# REVIEWS_JSON, applied (or not) by the caller before this ever runs.
# `_handoff_latest_reviews` below filters bots out first, because a
# Bot-authored review is not a human's standing position for either of its
# own callers. The three REST-shaped callers deliberately do not:
# `reviewDecision` — the selection filter they key off — counts bot reviews,
# and the marked reply they gather is the only event that can ever answer a
# bot's own CHANGES_REQUESTED, since the pipeline can neither dismiss a review
# on its own PR nor re-request a bot. Bot findings are addressed there; bots
# are just never pinged over them.
#
# Fails — printing nothing, jq's own non-zero status, jq's own diagnostics
# suppressed — on anything jq cannot iterate: malformed JSON, `null`, a
# scalar. That is the contract the live call sites are written against, every
# one of them guarding the call and leaving the enclosing work undone rather
# than finishing it on a guess: `|| return 0` in `lib/preflight.sh`'s
# `preflight_review_feedback_reason`, `|| return 1` in `_handoff_latest_
# reviews` below, `|| { printf 'unknown'; return; }` in
# `scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh`'s `_sweep_round_answered`, and
# `|| continue` in `scripts/gather-review-feedback.sh`'s per-PR loop. All four
# read the failure as "the reviews list could not be read" rather than as
# "nothing blocks this pull request"; do not soften it into an empty-array
# default, which would turn an unreadable list into a confident negative. An
# *empty* REVIEWS_JSON is the one input that neither succeeds usefully nor
# fails: jq runs the filter zero times, so the function prints nothing and
# exits 0. No live caller can reach it — each either validates its input as a
# JSON array first or builds one — and REVIEWS_JSON absent entirely is not a
# case at all, since every caller runs under `set -u`, where the unset `$2`
# aborts before jq is reached.

# either.
#
# The PR's author needs no exclusion — GitHub forbids requesting changes on

#   none       nobody's review blocks this PR — the ordinary path, and the
#              answer for every first-round pull request. One API call.
#   already    a re-review is pending from every blocking reviewer; whoever did
#              it (normally the Implementer, requirement 26b) got there first.
#   requested  this call asked, and GitHub now shows the request pending.
#   failed     the request could not be made, or did not take.
#
# Exit status is 0 for `none`, `already` and `requested`, 1 for `failed`.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# A human asks for changes; the Implementer answers them and pushes; the
# Reviewer confirms CI is green and reports `ready`. Every actor has done its
# job, and the pull request is now in a state no one is watching: its
# `reviewDecision` is still `CHANGES_REQUESTED` — the author cannot clear that,
# by design — and *no review is requested of anyone*, because the reviewer's
# request was consumed the moment they submitted the review that asked for the
# changes. It is not in their review queue. It is not in anyone's. It sits at
# whatever position in the PR list its last update earned it, indefinitely,
# looking to every dashboard like a handed-off success.
#
# That is exactly what happened to poetic-fiddle #200: reviewed 10:18, answered
# and pushed 21:33, a comment posted at 21:44 saying the point was addressed —
# and it reached the human only because they went looking. The draft flip
# (requirement 31a) cannot cover this: the PR never went back to draft, so
# `confirm_pr_ready` correctly answers `already` and correctly logs a completed
# handoff. The handoff was completed. It just did not reach anybody.
#
# ## Why the Script and not the prompt
#
# The Implementer prompt has told it to re-request review since the
# review-feedback source existed, and #200 is what that instruction is worth on
# its own: best-effort prose, unverified, and the one round it was skipped is
# the round nobody could see had gone wrong. This is requirement 31a's lesson in
# a second clothing — the report is not the deed — so the answer is the same
# one: the model may still do it, the Script asks GitHub whether it happened,
# and where it did not the Script does it. The judgement ("these changes answer
# the review") stays with the models; requesting a review is mechanism.
#
# ## What it does not do
#
# It does not clear the block, and must not appear to. Re-requesting review
# leaves `reviewDecision` at `CHANGES_REQUESTED` and `mergeable_state` at
# `blocked` — verified against GitHub on #200, before and after — so "The
# Landing Gate" holds unchanged, and the PR still needs an approving review
# from a code owner that this system cannot give itself. All this does is put
# the PR back in the queue the human actually reads.
#
# Nor does it fail the handoff when it fails. The PR is finished, green and
# visible; what is missing is a notification, and the Implementer's own reply
# comment (requirement 26b) mentions the reviewer, which notifies them too.
# Recording an `attempt-failed` here would put a certified pull request in front
# of the Enabler as a problem — the outcome requirement 31a exists to avoid — to
# repair a secondary alerting path. So the failure is a `warning` and a field on
# the `pr-ready` event: visible on the dashboard, and never a false failure.

# ensure_human_reviewer PR_URL ASSIGNEE
# Ensure a live review request is on a pull request whose next reviewer
# action belongs to a human, for the case `confirm_review_requested` does not
# cover: nobody's `CHANGES_REQUESTED` is blocking it, so there is no blocking
# reviewer to re-request from, and yet the pull request may still be sitting
# exactly where a human needs to look — a first review nobody has given, or
# an approval nobody has acted on since.
#
# This is agent-ops#242's poetic-fiddle #170: approved, green, and idle for
# 6.8 days, because CODEOWNERS' review request is consumed the moment the
# review is submitted and nothing ever asks again. Requesting review from
# someone who has already approved clears nothing they said — GitHub does not
# treat it as withdrawing the approval — it only puts the pull request back in
# the `pulls/review-requested` queue, which is the one dashboard a human
# actually watches. That is the whole point: this is a visibility nudge
# wearing the review-request mechanism, not a second review being solicited.
#
# The target is `_handoff_known_reviewers` (whoever has ever reviewed this
# pull request, in any state) before it is ever ASSIGNEE. That order matters
# on this system's own pull requests specifically: they are authored under
# the same account `enabler_assignee` routinely names (issue assignment has
# no such conflict; PR review does), and GitHub will refuse a review request
# aimed at a pull request's own author with a 422. CODEOWNERS already solved
# this once, automatically, the moment the pull request went ready — it never
# proposes the author as a reviewer of their own change — so reading who it
# already picked is both correct and one API call, where re-deriving the same
# answer from CODEOWNERS' file and org membership would be many. ASSIGNEE is
# the fallback for the one case that leaves nobody to read: a pull request
# CODEOWNERS never touched at all (no matching rule, or the repo does not use
# one).
#
# `_handoff_known_reviewers` only sees a reviewer who has *submitted* a
# review, which is not what CODEOWNERS' own auto-request actually leaves
# behind on a fresh pull request — a pending `requested_reviewers` entry,
# nobody having reviewed yet. Before this function existed to fall through to
# ASSIGNEE, that gap was invisible: this system's own pull requests have
# `assignee` equal to the author, so a first-round pull request with nobody's
# submitted review yet, but a live CODEOWNERS request already out for a
# *different* account, was misread as `skip\tno-candidate` — a live human
# review request already sitting on the pull request, reported as if none
# existed at all (agent-ops PRs #350, #353, #355; the two accounts are
# `@warwickallen`, this repo's own commit and comment identity, and
# `@Warwick-Allen`, its distinct human-review identity — both named in
# CODEOWNERS, so GitHub's own author-exclusion picks the latter without this
# function's help). So the already-pending `requested_reviewers` list is read
# too, before ASSIGNEE is ever considered: if it already names anyone,
# nothing needs asking — that candidate is reported as `already`, exactly the
# same shape a fresh request that turns out to already be pending gets below.
#
# Either way the author is struck off the candidates before anything is asked,
# never asked-for-and-refused: a 422 is not a transient failure worth warning
# about every cycle, it is a fact about the configuration that will not change
# tomorrow, and one invalid login fails the whole POST rather than its own
# entry. That filter is what makes `known` safe to trust — a `COMMENT` review
# is open to a pull request's author, so the reviews list can name them (see
# `_handoff_known_reviewers`) — and it is why ASSIGNEE equal to the author is a
# `skip` rather than an attempt.
#
# The no-candidate case carries its own detail (`skip\tno-candidate`),
# distinguishable from the other two `skip` reasons below (tech-debt/
# TD-PPagop-26081001.md): unlike a draft or a `CHANGES_REQUESTED`-blocked pull
# request — both fine to leave alone, since each has its own actor and its own
# clock — nothing else will ever ask this human, so a caller that cares (the
# periodic sweep, requirement 38c) needs to tell it apart from the other two
# to log a `warning` about it rather than passing over it in silence.
#
# Prints one of:
#   skip               the PR_URL is empty, the PR is a draft, or something is
#                       already `CHANGES_REQUESTED`-blocking it
#                       (confirm_review_requested's job, not this one's).
#   skip<TAB>no-candidate
#                       the only candidate target is the pull request's own
#                       author, and nobody else has a pending request
#                       either — there is nobody left to ask.
#   already             every candidate target already has a pending review
#                       request — including the case where nobody has
#                       reviewed yet, but somebody (typically CODEOWNERS)
#                       already has a request pending.
#   requested           this call asked, and GitHub now shows it pending.

#                       targets` below) failed specifically on a rate-limit

#                       operator reading the log needs to.
#
# Exit status is 0 for `skip` (either shape), `already` and `requested`, 1 for

# handoff_complete_review PR_URL DEFAULT_BRANCH ASSIGNEE [ROUND_STARTED_AT]
# The one gate-and-flip implementation requirement 31c and 32b both bind
# (agent-ops#440): run requirement 31c's review gate, requirement 25a's
# closing-keyword gate, requirement 25c's changelog-section gate
# (agent-ops#1808) and requirement 31c's reconciliation gate
# (agent-ops#533) against the pull request's *current* state, and only once
# all four are clean, perform the handoff itself — the draft flip
# (`confirm_pr_ready`), the re-request of a blocking reviewer's review
# (`confirm_review_requested`), and the nudge to a first or idle reviewer
# (`ensure_human_reviewer`, targeted at ASSIGNEE). A `dirty` reconciliation
# verdict does not merely refuse: it reverts the pull request to draft
# (`confirm_pr_draft`, agent-ops#539) rather than leaving it exactly as the
# Reviewer's own step-7 `gh pr ready` had just left it — see that function's
# own header and `_reconciliation_gate_anchor`'s for why an un-reverted flip
# defeats this gate one round after the round it was refused in. Every one of
# these calls is asked fresh here rather than reused from anything a caller
# read earlier in its own engagement, for the same reason `lib/review-gate.sh`
# gives its own two checks: a state read once and trusted twice is exactly
# what let poetic-fiddle #216's CodeQL alert through a Reviewer's own "CI is
# green" judgement.
#
# Before this function existed, that five-call sequence was two separate
# copies: the Reviewer's own handoff ran all five, inline, in agent-cycle.sh;
# the Enabler's `complete_handoff` recovery path ran only the last three,
# because the first two were never written into it at all. A `complete_
# handoff` on a pull request whose required checks were red, or which carried
# a fresh security-severity code-scanning alert, flipped it to ready anyway —
# the gate requirement 31c exists for was simply absent from that path. One
# function both paths call is what makes that class of drift structurally
# impossible rather than merely undesirable (requirement 34a) — which is why
# the reconciliation gate, and now its revert-on-refusal, were added here, in
# this one function, rather than beside the Reviewer's own handoff site alone.
#
# Prints one JSON object:
#
#   {
#     "safe": true|false,
#     "gate": {"word": "clean"|"dirty"|"unknown", "reason": "…",
#               "checks_unreadable": true|false},
#     "closing_keyword": {"word": "clean"|"dirty"|"unknown", "reason": "…"},
#     "changelog_section": {"word": "clean"|"dirty"|"unknown", "reason": "…"},
#     "reconciliation": {"word": "clean"|"dirty"|"unknown", "reason": "…"},

#     "rereview": {"state": "…", "who": "…"},
#     "human_reviewer": {"state": "…", "who": "…"}
#   }
#
# `safe` is the one field a caller must branch on before doing anything else:
# `false` means the pull request must not be handed off, full stop, and every
# field past the one that stopped it is empty except `revert` — there is
# nothing further to report, because nothing further ran. It is false for
# exactly six reasons, in the order they are checked (a `dirty` review gate
# outranks everything else, the same "the pull request's own fault always
# wins" rule `review_gate_verdict` already applies between its own two
# sub-checks):
#
#   - `gate.word` is `dirty` — a required check is red, or a required-check
#     list came back empty (`lib/review-gate.sh`'s own conflicting-PR-runs-
#     no-CI trap), or a fresh security-severity code-scanning alert sits on
#     the branch.
#   - `gate.checks_unreadable` is `true` — the required-check list itself
#     could not be read at all (a node fact, `review_gate_verdict`'s exit 2).
#     This is `unknown` in `gate.word` too, but the caller must branch on
#     `checks_unreadable`, not the word, for the same reason
#     `review_gate_verdict`'s own header gives: a dirty alert can win the word
#     while the required-checks read still failed underneath it, and a caller
#     that only looked at the word would treat that as "nothing wrong with
#     the checks" and falsely reset a streak counting how often this node's
#     `gh` goes dark.
#   - `closing_keyword.word` is `dirty` — the pull request claims to close an
#     issue and its body does not, or does not any longer.
#   - `changelog_section.word` is `dirty` — the pull request's title owes a
#     `## Changelog` section (requirement 25c) and the description does not
#     carry one of the shape that requirement states, or does not any longer
#     (`lib/changelog-section-gate.sh`, agent-ops#1808, on the closing-keyword
#     gate's own pattern). Checked after `closing_keyword`, for the same
#     reason: both are pull-request *body* edits the Reviewer's own step 4
#     already fixes, so whichever fires first is reported and the other is
#     simply not asked yet — a caller that fixes one and re-runs this
#     function will see the other if it too is still dirty.
#   - `reconciliation.word` is `dirty` — a human posted a general PR comment
#     since the pull request last left draft, and no pipeline comment since
#     cites a `<!-- agent-ops:reconciles comment=<id> -->` line naming it
#     (`lib/reconciliation-gate.sh`, agent-ops#533). This is the one branch
#     that populates `revert`: `confirm_pr_draft` is called before returning,
#     and its word — `reverted`, `already-draft`, or `failed` — is carried in
#     `revert` so a caller can tell "the refusal took, the pull request is a
#     draft again" from "the refusal was recorded but the pull request is
#     still sitting ready" (`revert: "failed"`), which is worth a warning of
#     its own since whatever lands next — a human, or the Script itself at a
#     higher `merge_autonomy` rung — could otherwise merge a
#     `CHANGES_REQUESTED` pull request that reads as ready.
#   - Neither gate found anything, but the flip itself did not take —
#     `handoff` is `failed`. This is the one `safe: false` shape that still
#     names a stage: `handoff` carries `"failed"` so a caller can tell "this
#     pull request has a real, nameable problem" apart from "the gates were
#     clean and confirm_pr_ready simply could not confirm the flip", which
#     reads differently to a human. `revert` is empty here — the
#     reconciliation gate was clean, so nothing was reverted.
#
# `gate.word`/`closing_keyword.word`/`changelog_section.word`/
# `reconciliation.word` being `unknown` does not, on its own, make `safe`
# false — an alerts read, a closing-keyword read, a changelog-section read or
# a reconciliation read that could not be asked at all is a node or token
# fact (see each gate's own header for why), and blocking every handoff on it
# forever would trade one hazard for a worse one. Only `gate.checks_
# unreadable` refuses on an `unknown`; the caller is still expected to warn
# on the other three rather than pass them over in silence — read them off
# the JSON and log accordingly, the same way agent-cycle.sh's Reviewer and
# Enabler call sites both do.
#
# `rereview` and `human_reviewer` are only ever populated once `safe` is
# `true` and the flip itself succeeded — the same guard `confirm_review_
# requested`/`ensure_human_reviewer` are given inline today. `human_reviewer`
# stays empty (`{"state": "", "who": ""}`) whenever `rereview.state` is not
# `none`, or ASSIGNEE is empty — precisely `ensure_human_reviewer`'s own
# existing precondition, applied here rather than by the caller, so a caller
# cannot forget it.
#
# ROUND_STARTED_AT is the timestamp this cycle began (agent-cycle.sh's
# `cycle_started_at`), passed straight through to `reconciliation_gate` as its
# anchor bound. It is what stops that gate from measuring "since the pull
# request last left draft" against a draft flip the Reviewer performed inside
# this very round — see `_reconciliation_gate_anchor`'s own comment for the
# reproduction. Both callers pass it; omitting it leaves the gate unbounded,
# which is only ever right for a caller that performed no flip of its own.
#
# Never returns non-zero: every sub-call already fails closed on its own
# terms, and the caller reads `safe` and the sub-verdicts rather than an exit
# status — the same convention `review_gate_verdict` established for its own
# combined word, extended one level up.

# Print, sorted oldest first, the timestamp of every event that answers a

# comment carrying `lib/pipeline-marker.sh`'s marker with `actor=implementer`
# — found in REVIEWS_JSON or COMMENTS_JSON, and, only where REREQUESTS_JSON
# names one, a review-requested timeline event. REVIEWS_JSON and
# COMMENTS_JSON are arrays of objects carrying at least `at` (a timestamp)
# and `body`; extra fields (`id`, `state`, `who`, …) are ignored, so a caller
# may pass whatever shape it already fetched. REREQUESTS_JSON is an array of
# objects carrying `at`; omit it (or pass `[]`) to read the marked-reply
# signal alone.
#
# All three arrive on stdin, one document each (requirement 4g,
# TD-PPagop-26081501). Hand over exactly one document per argument: the three
# are bound positionally, so a caller that concatenates pages — an unslurped
# `gh api --paginate` read — would shift every later binding onto the wrong
# value. That is refused rather than read: any document left unconsumed after
# the three bindings, and any unparseable trailing bytes, exit 5 with
# `handoff_answer_events: multiple JSON documents in one argument` on stderr
# and print nothing. A caller must handle that ending — `handoff_round_answered`
# below reads it as `unknown`, never `answered`.
#
# This is the extraction requirement 3c's candidate rule
# (scripts/gather-review-feedback.sh) has always made; it lives here so a
# second caller — `handoff_round_answered` below, and through it
# scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh (requirement 38c) — shares the one
# definition (requirement 34a) instead of re-deriving it
# (tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26080804.md). See gather-review-feedback.sh's own
# header for why events, not a commit's `committedDate`, are what "answered"
# reads: a force-push re-stamps every commit's date to push time without a
# human, or the agent, having answered anything (agent-ops#239, PR #205).
#
# Only `actor=implementer` closes a round. The marker also carries
# `actor=script`, `actor=enabler`, `actor=reviewer` and `actor=refiner` for
# other pipeline writes, and two of those are by definition not answers:
# `actor=script` records a stage giving up, `actor=enabler` a stall being
# diagnosed. On PR #269 exactly those two comments closed a round under the
# old "any marked reply" rule, and the work sat stranded until a human was
# escalated (agent-ops#278). A legacy marker with no `actor=` field at all
# does not answer the round either, for the same reason.

  # positionally with `input as $name` in the order printed, never in argv.
  #
  # The trailing `[inputs]` guard stands in for the rejection `--argjson`
  # used to perform for a multi-document argument — two concatenated arrays,
  # the shape an unslurped `gh api --paginate` read leaves behind, which it

  # so a caller that hands over more than one document per argument would
  # otherwise shift every later binding onto the wrong value instead of
  # failing (test/handoff.test.sh's "two concatenated pages" pin). Three
  # well-formed single-document arguments leave nothing behind, and an
  # argument that over-contributes leaves at least one document unconsumed,
  # so a non-empty remainder is the assertion. The count is exact only while
  # no argument contributes *zero* documents; both callers slurp each one
  # with `jq -s -c` first, which guarantees exactly one, and this guard is
  # the backstop for a third that does not.
  #
  # It counts the remainder with `[inputs]` rather than binding one more
  # document, because each obvious spelling of that is wrong — all three

  #
  #   - `(try input catch null) as $extra` is caught by its own `try`. On

  #     the same pipeline, rebinding `$extra` to `null` and re-running the
  #     else branch — so the guard never fires at all and the test pin above
  #     fails, while CI's jq 1.7 image passes it;
  #   - comparing that binding against `null` cannot tell "nothing left" from
  #     a trailing document that *is* `null`, on either version;
  #   - catching the read at all swallows a JSON *parse* error in trailing
  #     bytes, which `--argjson` rejected too.
  #
  # `[inputs] | length` raises none of the three: it consumes whatever

# `review-feedback`, `merge-conflicts`, `dequeued`, `abandoned-drafts` — the
# ones that finish an already-open pull request rather than start a new one,
# which is the one activity a tripped back-pressure gate still permits.
# Anything else in `sources` (`security`, `tech-debt`, `issues`, …) is dropped;
# a repo whose own `sources` carries none of the four is left with an empty
# list, same as `map(select(...))` always did.
#
# This is the one definition of that filter: agent-cycle.sh's own back-pressure
# block calls it instead of inlining the `map(select(...))` expression, and so
# does every test that pins the narrowing, rather than each hand-copying the
# four source names and drifting the moment a fifth finishing source is added
# (issue #431 — four stale hand-copies were found the moment `dequeued` became
# the fourth). Fields other than `sources` (`issues`, `tech_debt`, …) are left
# untouched; callers that also need those emptied do that separately, since
# it is not part of this same rule and no caller of this function duplicates
# it.
