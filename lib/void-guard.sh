# lib/void-guard.sh — what any stage must produce before one of its `void`
# verdicts is allowed to be permanent (requirement 34d).
#
# `void` is the only terminal state in the system. Requirement 34c makes that
# deliberate and one-directional: no agent may clear a void, because the only
# evidence that could ever arrive — "the work is already done" — is the reason
# the item is void, so an agent permitted to weigh it would reason its way out
# of every void it met. Only a human, appending `unvoided` by hand, can reverse
# one.
#
# That asymmetry is right, and it makes *creating* a void the dangerous act.
# The system's own note on requirement 34c says creating is safe where clearing
# is not — "a wrong void costs a human one line in a log". It costs more than
# that, because nothing will ever tell the human the line is needed. A wrong
# void is silent: the item vanishes from selection, the Co-Ordinator that
# skipped it reports `none-selected`, the no-op fingerprint (requirement 3b)
# then matches on every following cycle and the fleet stands down without even
# buying a Co-Ordinator turn. The pipeline looks healthy and idle. It is idle
# because it has been lied to.
#
# The PR-diff check below only fires when the voided repo+item matches a
# gathered candidate carrying a `pr_number` — the finishing sources
# (review-feedback, merge-conflicts, dequeued, abandoned-drafts).
# `landing-refusals` (requirement 53) is deliberately not a fifth here: a
# landing-refusals void report needs an ordinary PR/commit/file citation, not
# this auto-corroboration — see issue #1481, which tracks whether it should
# share it. For everything else —
# most tech-debt items, every review recommendation, a failed-runs entry —
# nothing tested the citation itself, only that the `evidence` field was
# non-empty, and a model willing to assert a false reason is just as willing
# to write a plausible-looking free-text citation for it (TD26072601). So a
# second, independent test resolves what it can: an `evidence` value shaped
# `{ref, path, expect, pattern}` names a specific file at a specific ref and a
# specific claim about it, which is exactly as checkable as a PR diff — fetch
# it and see. A citation that does not take that shape but names a PR or a
# commit is checked live against the item instead (`void_citation_reason`,
# below). One that takes neither shape — unstructured prose with no PR/commit
# citation, and not a finishing-source item whose own id names the pull
# request to finish — is refused outright (issue #413, WI-10): accepting it on
# the strength of merely being non-empty was TD26072601's own deliberate
# carve-out, and it is exactly the fall-through the shipped defect below
# walked through. A citation that does take a checkable shape but does not
# hold when fetched is refused too, on the same "uncorroborated is not
# innocent" reasoning as an unreadable PR.
#
# It happened. A Co-Ordinator voided a tech-debt item with
# "PR #92 work is finished: workflow timeout, fetch timeouts, retry-on-rejection
# and tests all merged; TECH-DEBT.md Ledger marked resolved" — while the
# workflow file on the default branch still had no timeout, the Ledger row still
# read `open`, and the PR was still an open, conflicted draft. Every clause was
# checkable, and none of it was checked. The item was unreachable from both
# directions after that: void as a tech-debt candidate, and void as the
# abandoned-draft that would have finished it, because a void keys on the item
# and so bypasses the per-head refs (requirements 3e, 3g) that exist precisely
# so a changed state gets a fresh look.
#
# ## Why the guard lives here and not in the prompt
#
# The obvious repair is to tell the model to be more careful. That is not a
# repair: "be certain" is already in prompts/coordinator.md, twice, and the
# model that voided #92 was certain. Nor is it enough to point at which stage
# can see the most — the Co-Ordinator reads a JSON digest of candidates and
# nothing else, but the Implementer (requirement 27b) and the Enabler
# (requirement 35) read the tree, the issue and the PR directly, and issue #243
# is what a Co-Ordinator void looked like anyway: it voided #224 citing "PR
# #232 implemented all five rewrites" — a real, mergeable PR, just one that
# belonged to #221. Every mechanical test that already existed passed, because
# none of them had ever asked whether the cited PR was *about this item*.
# Reading more context does not stop a model from citing the wrong artifact
# inside it; only checking the citation does.
#
# So the guard is mechanical, and it runs on the Script's side of the boundary
# — for every stage that can write `item-void` (the Co-Ordinator, the Enabler,
# the Implementer), through the one shared entry point, `void_guard_reason`:
#
#   1. **Evidence must exist.** Requirement 34c has always said an `item-void`
#      carries `reason` *and* `evidence` — "the SHAs, paths, or commands proving
#      there is no work", so a human can audit the verdict without redoing the
#      investigation. The Co-Ordinator's `voided` entries never carried it, and
#      the Script never asked; the false void above was recorded with a reason
#      and nothing else. An entry with no evidence is not a verdict, it is an
#      opinion, and opinions are not terminal.
#   2. **This cycle's own candidates must not refute it.** A void asserts the
#      work is already on the default branch. When the item has an open pull
#      request among the candidates this very cycle gathered, that assertion is
#      testable for the price of one API call: a PR whose diff against its base
#      is non-empty is a PR whose changes are, by definition, not on the base.
#      No amount of model confidence survives that. (Co-Ordinator only — it is
#      the only stage with a gathered candidate list to test against.)
#   3. **A cited PR or commit must actually be about this item** (issue #243).
#      Evidence naming "PR #N" or a commit SHA — or a GitHub PR/commit URL
#      (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<n>` or `.../commit/<sha>`),
#      the form `gh pr view`/`gh pr create` print and so the one a model is
#      most likely to paste — is fetched live and checked for the item id in
#      the PR's body/branch, or the commit's message/associated PRs — see
#      `void_citation_reason` below. A bare "PR #N"/SHA citation resolves
#      against the entry's own `repo`, as before; a URL citation carries its
#      own `owner/repo` and is resolved against *that*, never against the
#      entry's `repo`, so a citation of another repository's PR is not tested
#      against the wrong repository. This is what requirement 34d was missing
#      before #243: a citation that merely *exists* is not corroboration, and
#      it is checked the same way for every stage, since it needs nothing but
#      the API and the citation itself.
#   4. **Evidence that fits none of the checkable shapes is refused, not
#      waved through** (issue #413, WI-10). Checks 1-3 above only ever
#      *strengthened* what a non-empty `evidence` field could pass with; until
#      now, prose carrying neither the structured shape nor a PR/commit
#      citation still passed on presence alone — the exact hole
#      `void_entry_resolvable_evidence`'s own comment named as a deliberate
#      carve-out (TD26072601), because closing it seemed to demand every void
#      fit one mould. It does not: `void_guard_reason` now accepts evidence in
#      exactly three checkable shapes — the structured shape (must resolve), a
#      PR/commit citation (must corroborate), or a finishing-source item whose
#      own id names the pull request to finish, corroborated the same way
#      `void_finishing_pr_reason` already corroborates one cited by the id
#      shortcut in check 3 — and refuses anything else outright, naming what
#      was missing. Prior art #243 closed the citation gap and left this one
#      open, on the reasoning that a human backstop (the `unvoided` label)
#      covered the residual; D18 retires that backstop, so the residual is
#      closed here instead.
#
# ## What a refused void becomes
#
# Not nothing, and not a human's problem: `blocked` (requirement 32a). Blocked
# is the clearable twin of void — the Co-Ordinator skips it, so the item does
# not churn, and it becomes Enabler-eligible under requirement 35a, so an actor
# that *can* read the tree adjudicates it. If the item really is done, the
# Enabler voids it properly, with evidence, and the state is reached by the
# route that can be audited. The pipeline gets to the same answer; it just is
# not allowed to get there by assertion.
#
# Sourced, never executed: it sets no shell options, because agent-cycle.sh
# runs under `set -euo pipefail`.
#

# void_draft_obsolete_flag_reason SLUG ITEM CTX_JSON
# The machine-checkable alternative to the human `obsolete` label (issue
# #413, WI-10; design doc §5.5): a two-touch confirmation that a draft pull
# request is unwanted, usable only where the installation trusts the fleet
# enough to act on it without a human's label — `merge_autonomy_effective_
# level` `agent-merges-all` for this repo, which the Script resolves once
# and hands down as CTX_JSON's `merge_autonomy_level`, never re-derived
# here (this file has no access to config or the kill switch, by design —
# see lib/merge-autonomy.sh).
#
# Prints nothing and returns 0 the moment one `draft-obsolete-flagged` event
# in CTX_JSON's `flags` array — `{repo, item, pr, evidence, cycle, node,
# ts}`, written by agent-cycle.sh when an earlier, independent Enabler
# verdict flagged this same draft as unwanted (a flag is never itself a
# void, so this can never be an engagement corroborating its own judgement)
# — corroborates, on **all** of:
#
#   - the flag names this SLUG (case-insensitive) and this ITEM;
#   - the flag's `cycle` differs from CTX_JSON's own `cycle` — a second,
#     independent look, never the same engagement re-asserting itself;
#   - the flag's `ts` is at least 24 hours before CTX_JSON's `now_epoch` —
#     time for anything that would unflag it (a push, a comment) to have
#     happened; a flag younger than that has not had that time and does not
#     corroborate yet, however the other three conditions read;
#   - the flag's own `evidence`, exactly like the current void's own
#     (CTX_JSON's `current_structured_resolved`, computed by
#     `void_guard_reason` and never trusted from the flag's own say-so),
#     is the structured `{ref, path, expect, pattern}` shape and resolves
#     live against SLUG. Free prose does not corroborate here even though it
#     can corroborate an ordinary void (`void_citation_reason`) — this path
#     is not gated behind a human's review at all, so both touches earn the
#     strictest evidence bar this guard has.
#
# Prints a one-line reason and returns 1 when CTX_JSON's own level is not
# `agent-merges-all`, when the current void's evidence is not itself
# structured-and-resolving, or when no flag satisfies every condition above
# — the caller (`void_finishing_pr_reason`) treats this the same as an

# void_finishing_pr_reason SLUG NUM ITEM [CTX_JSON]
# Decide whether NUM, the pull request a finishing-source ITEM was minted
# from, corroborates a void of that item. Prints nothing and returns 0 when
# it does; prints a one-line reason and returns 1 otherwise.
#
# CTX_JSON (default `{}`) carries what the machine `obsolete` alternative
# below needs and nothing else — `merge_autonomy_level`, `current_
# structured_resolved`, `cycle`, `now_epoch`, `flags` — all optional; any
# field it omits simply keeps that alternative unreachable rather than
# failing. Every existing caller keeps working with none of this: three
# positional arguments is still a complete, valid call.
#
# A finishing-source item exists only to finish one specific, named pull
# request, so the void is decided against that PR's own live state, fetched
# here (never from a gathered candidate list, so this works identically for a
# stage that has no such list — the Enabler, the Implementer). A pull request
# the API will not answer for is refused whatever the shape: an unreadable
# citation corroborates nothing.
#
# **Merged or otherwise closed corroborates every shape outright.** There is
# no more finishing to do on a pull request that will never land via this
# route, whatever state the underlying work is in. GitHub reports merged and
# closed-unmerged alike under `state: "closed"`; a void does not need to know
# which.
#
# **An open pull request is read against what its own shape claims, and the
# strictness is calibrated to what requirement 34k then does with the void:**
#
#   - `pr-<n>-abandoned-…`, `pr-<n>-review-…` — a corroborated void of these
#     makes 34k *close pull request `<n>`*, with a comment. That is a
#     destructive, human-visible act on someone's live branch, and closing one
#     on an unexamined claim is precisely how pull request #264 and its human
#     `CHANGES_REQUESTED` round were lost (TD-PPagop-26080901). So an open PR
#     is read two ways, either of which corroborates: an **empty diff against
#     its base** — whatever this item was to finish is already in the base, so
#     closing the PR discards nothing — or the pull request already carrying
#     the human-applied **`obsolete` label**, checked live off the same
#     fetch that read `state`, before the `/files` call below is ever made
#     (TD-PPagop-26081308). That label is the deliberate, corroborable "no
#     longer wanted" signal a diff can never be: no pipeline stage may ever
#     apply it (lib/labels.sh's catalogue comment, prompts/implementer.md's
#     prohibition) — a stage that could would be corroborating its own
#     judgement. **A machine-checkable alternative to the label** (issue
#     #413, WI-10, design doc §5.5) corroborates too, but only at
#     `merge_autonomy_effective_level` `agent-merges-all` for this repo
#     (CTX_JSON's `merge_autonomy_level`): a two-touch confirmation — a
#     `draft-obsolete-flagged` log event an earlier, independent Enabler
#     verdict left (see `void_draft_obsolete_flag_reason` below) — an
#     Enabler flagging a draft is not itself a void, so this is never the
#     same engagement corroborating its own judgement — read at least 24
#     hours old, from a different cycle than this void's own, with both
#     touches' evidence in the structured `{ref, path, expect, pattern}`
#     shape and resolving live. An open pull request with none of an empty
#     diff, the label, or a corroborating flag is refused and escalated:
#     that claim is a judgement no API call can corroborate on its own, and
#     a human is the right one to make it, either by resolving the item
#     honestly or by applying the label.
#   - `pr-<n>-conflict-…` — a corroborated void of this shape closes *nothing*
#     (requirement 34k excludes it, TD-PPagop-26080901: the void says the
#     **conflict** resolved, not the pull request, which stays a live PR of
#     ours). An empty diff is therefore not the claim being made, and
#     demanding one would refuse every honest void this shape can write. The
#     test is the mirror of the one that minted the item instead
#     (`gather-merge-conflicts.sh`): the void is refused only while the API
#     still reports the PR **definitively conflicting** (`mergeable: false`).
#     A `mergeable` GitHub has not finished computing (`null`) reads as not
#     definitively conflicting and is accepted, the same asymmetry the
#     gatherer chose in the other direction — it admits a candidate on
#     `CONFLICTING` and never on the transient `UNKNOWN`.
#   - `pr-<n>-dequeued-…` — a corroborated void of this shape also closes
#     *nothing* (requirement 34k excludes it too, TD-PPagop-26081409), for the
#     same reason as `-conflict-`: the void says the *dequeue* resolved, not
#     the pull request. The test again mirrors the one that minted the item
#     (`gather-dequeued.sh`): refused only while the pull request's *current*
#     head still matches the head SHA the item's own id embeds **and**
#     `lib/merge-queue.sh`'s `merge_queue_probe`, re-read live, still reports
#     it not re-queued. A head that has moved (a fix landed, whichever cycle's)
#     or a probe that cannot answer both read as resolved, the same
#     "ambiguous accepts" asymmetry the conflict shape's `null` mergeable gets.
#   - `pr-<n>-superseded-…` — a corroborated void of this shape *does* close
#     pull request `<n>` (requirement 34k's ordinary act-on-void path, once
#     the id shape distinguishes it from `-conflict-`). Closing a Dependabot
#     PR is not the same act as closing a human-visible PR of ours — nobody is
#     mid-review on the bot's own branch — but it is still an irreversible,
#     human-visible act on GitHub, so it earns its own live check rather than
#     the conflict shape's mergeability test, which proves the wrong claim
#     here (a superseded bump can be superseded whether or not it still
#     conflicts). Accepted only when **both** hold, re-derived live and never
#     read off the entry's own `evidence`: the PR's author is
#     `dependabot[bot]` (`DEPENDABOT_LOGIN` is the GraphQL form the gatherer
#     reads; the REST fetch here reports the same account this way — see
#     `lib/dependabot-bump.sh`), and `dependabot_newer_open_pr`, re-run now
#     against the repository's *currently* open Dependabot pull requests,
#     still names a strictly-newer open bump of the same family. Either half
#     failing refuses with a reason naming which one. The listing that answers
#     the second half is bounded at `GITHUB_PR_LIST_LIMIT` — the same stated
#     cap the gatherer read at (lib/github-limit.sh) — and an empty answer
#     from a listing at that cap refuses naming the cap, because "no newer
#     bump in the first N" is not "no newer bump". This is the excuse
#     `-conflict-` used to carry for Dependabot before this shape existed
#     (TD-PPagop-26081304) — moved here because the claim it excuses
#     ("superseded") now has its own shape to be corroborated against, rather
#     than riding on a shape whose own test it can never honestly pass.

# void_pr_matches_item SLUG NUM ITEM ENTRY_REPO [CTX_JSON]
# Test one cited PR against the item it is supposed to corroborate: fetched
# live from the API — never from a gathered candidate list, so this works
# identically for a stage that has no such list (the Enabler, the
# Implementer) — and checked for ITEM in its body or its head branch, the same
# two places `scripts/gather-*.sh` reads to associate a PR with an item in the
# first place. Prints nothing and returns 0 on a match; prints a one-line
# reason and returns 1 otherwise, including when the PR cannot be read at all
# — an unreadable citation corroborates nothing.
#
# One item shape is corroborated differently: a finishing-source item *is* a
# pull request. The gatherers mint its id from the PR's own number —
# `pr-<n>-abandoned-<head-sha>`, `pr-<n>-review-<review-id>`,
# `pr-<n>-conflict-<head-sha>`, `pr-<n>-superseded-<head-sha>`,
# `pr-<n>-dequeued-<head-sha>`
# (scripts/gather-abandoned-drafts.sh, gather-review-feedback.sh,
# gather-merge-conflicts.sh, gather-dequeued.sh) — so citing that very pull
# request is not a loose association, it is the item's own definition.
# Nothing will ever write `pr-205-abandoned-1a2b3c4d5e6f` in PR #205's body or
# branch name, so the body/branch test below would refuse the most natural
# evidence these items can carry. That refusal would fall precisely on the
# sources the guard corroborates best, so the id is read for what it already
# says: NUM is handed to `void_finishing_pr_reason` instead of to the
# body/branch test, which corroborates it against the PR's own live state
# (TD-PPagop-26080807) rather than accepting the id's say-so with no fetch at
# all, as this once did.
#
# That live check is the whole of the corroboration these items get, in every
# stage — `void_candidate_prs` never backstopped them and cannot. It matches a
# candidate's `.item`, and a finishing-source id is never a candidate's
# `.item`: the gatherers put it in `.ref` and leave `.item` as whatever
# register id the branch or body named, or `null`
# (`scripts/gather-abandoned-drafts.sh`, `gather-review-feedback.sh`,
# `gather-merge-conflicts.sh`, `gather-dequeued.sh`). So the Co-Ordinator's extra candidate-diff test
# is silent on this shape exactly as the Enabler's and the Implementer's
# `repos: []` calls are, which is why the fetch here has to be the thing that
# looks.
#
# What the id says is scoped, though: it was minted from a pull request in
# ENTRY_REPO — the entry's own `repo` — and carries no slug of its own, so the
# shortcut is taken only when SLUG *is* ENTRY_REPO (case-insensitive, as
# GitHub treats slugs). A URL citation naming another repository's pull
# request `<n>` merely coincides on the number, and an entry naming no repo
# minted nothing; both fall through to the body/branch test below, which can
# still corroborate them the ordinary way (issue #290).

# Test one cited commit against the item it is supposed to corroborate. Two
# facts must both hold:
#
#   1. SHA is an ancestor of the repository's default branch — via the
#      compare API rather than a local clone, since this guard runs from
#      wherever the writing stage runs, not necessarily inside a checkout of
#      SLUG. `compare/SHA...default_branch` reports `identical` or `ahead`
#      exactly when default_branch contains everything SHA does — the
#      definition of "SHA has already landed".
#   2. Something ties SHA to ITEM: its own commit message names it, or a pull
#      request GitHub associates with it does (checked the same way a cited PR
#      is — `void_pr_matches_item`, with ENTRY_REPO passed through, since its
#      id shortcut needs the entry's own repo to compare SLUG against). A
#      squash-merge commit's message is the PR title, which does not reliably
#      repeat an item id, so the associated-PR fallback is not optional
#      polish; without it almost every genuine commit citation would be
#      refused.
#
# Prints nothing and returns 0 when both hold; prints a one-line reason and
# returns 1 otherwise.

# void_citation_reason ENTRY_JSON REPO_SLUG [CTX_JSON]
# The corroboration requirement 34d's window exposed: evidence existing, and
# even resolving, is not the same as evidence *connecting to this item*. The
# Co-Ordinator once voided an item citing "PR #232 implemented all five
# rewrites" — #232 was a real, mergeable PR, so every check that had ever run
# against it (evidence non-empty, PR diff empty) passed. It belonged to a
# different item entirely. Nothing had ever asked whether the PR it cited was
# about *this* item.
#
# This asks exactly that, and it is what makes the guard usable by the
# Enabler and the Implementer as well as the Co-Ordinator: unlike
# `void_candidate_prs`, it needs no cycle-gathered candidate list — every
# citation is resolved live against the API — so a stage that never gathered
# candidates in the first place gets the same check.
#
# The extractors return `slug#number`/`slug#sha` pairs: a bare "PR #N"/SHA
# citation carries REPO_SLUG (possibly empty), while a URL citation carries
# the `owner/repo` the URL itself names. Each pair is resolved against its
# own slug, never against REPO_SLUG — a cross-repo URL citation would
# otherwise be tested against the wrong repository, and REPO_SLUG is only
# what a *bare* citation falls back to. REPO_SLUG is also handed to each
# check as the entry's own repo: it is what gates `void_pr_matches_item`'s
# finishing-source id shortcut to citations of the entry's own repository
# (issue #290).
#
# Prints nothing and returns 0 when the evidence cites no PR or commit at all
# (nothing to corroborate this way; the presence/resolvable rules above are
# what govern free prose), or when every citation it does make checks out.
# Prints a one-line reason and returns 1 the moment one citation does not —
# a partly-fabricated citation is a fabricated citation.

# void_guard_reason ENTRY_JSON REPOS_JSON [CTX_JSON]
# Decide whether a void may be recorded as terminal. Shared by all three
# stages that write `item-void` (requirement 34d, extended by issue #243 from
# "the Co-Ordinator" to "every stage"): the Co-Ordinator passes REPOS_JSON, its
# gathered candidates, so `void_candidate_prs` below can also weigh in;
# the Enabler and the Implementer have no such list and call this with `[]`,
# which simply skips that one extra check — the checks below need nothing
# from it, since every one resolves live.
#
# CTX_JSON (default `{}`) carries what the machine `obsolete` alternative
# needs — `merge_autonomy_level`, `cycle`, `now_epoch`, `flags` (issue #413,
# WI-10; see `void_draft_obsolete_flag_reason`) — computed once by the Script
# and handed down unchanged; every field is optional, and omitting all of
# them (every caller before WI-10, and both `void_guard_reason` calls in this
# file's own tests unless a test says otherwise) simply keeps that
# alternative unreachable. This function adds its own `current_structured_
# resolved` to what it forwards to `void_citation_reason` and the direct
# finishing-item check below — never trusted from the caller, always derived
# from whether the structured-shape check just below actually passed.
#
# Prints nothing and returns 0 when it may. Prints a one-line reason and
# returns 1 when it may not — the line is written to be readable in a log event
# and on the dashboard without the reader having to reconstruct the cycle.
#
# Every failure mode returns 1, including the ones that are nobody's fault (an
# API that would not answer). Refusing costs a blocked item that the Enabler
# will look at; accepting costs an item nothing will ever look at again.
#
# Accepted evidence is a closed list (issue #413, WI-10 — before this, prose
# with neither shape below passed on being merely non-empty, which is exactly
# how the shipped defect at the top of this file was recorded): (a) the
# structured `{ref, path, expect, pattern}` shape, checked here, which must
# resolve; (b) free text carrying at least one PR/commit citation, checked via
# `void_citation_reason`, every one of which must corroborate; (c) a
# finishing-source item — one whose own id names the pull request it exists to
# finish — corroborated directly against that pull request's own live state
# via `void_finishing_pr_reason`, independently of whatever the entry's
# `evidence` field says, since these items were always decided against the
# named pull request rather than against the prose. All three are checked
# whenever they apply — a finishing-source item cited by number in the
# evidence text gets both (b) and (c), which is redundant but never
# contradictory, since both resolve to the same live fetch — and any one of
# them failing refuses the void outright, even when another already
# succeeded: each is independent corroboration, not an alternative to be
# skipped once one has passed. An entry for which none applies is refused
# with a reason naming what was missing, rather than accepted on presence
# alone.
