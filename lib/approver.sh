# lib/approver.sh — the Approver stage's own decision primitives (D18 WI-5,
# agent-ops#408; design: docs/reviews/2026-08-14-autonomy-investigation.md
# §5.2/§5.3).
#
# `merge_autonomy` above `human` (lib/merge-autonomy.sh) needs a non-author
# identity to hold review rights, since GitHub refuses self-approval and this
# pipeline authors as its own configured owner — that identity is the
# "Pullwright Approver" GitHub App, whose installation-token minting
# lib/approver-token.sh already provides (D18 WI-4). This file is what turns
# a minted token into an actual judgement: which tier a pull request's
# complexity grade routes to, whether a run of consecutive refusals has
# reached the point a Standard/High engagement must yield to a critical-tier
# adjudication instead, and the two GitHub writes the Script performs on the
# Approver's own verdict — never the model's.
#
# Four tiers, mirroring the owner's own delegation ladder (§5.2):
#   trivial       complexity:low — deterministic, no model call at all. The
#                 grading rubric (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md
#                 requirement 26a) already forces anything touching
#                 concurrency, security, CI/workflow machinery or shared
#                 library code to grade `high`, never `low` — so the
#                 protected-paths classifier `lib/landing.sh` adds (WI-7) is
#                 a second fence around ground the complexity label already
#                 fences off, not this tier's only guard.
#   standard      complexity:medium — one engagement on `approver_model_default`.
#   high          complexity:high — one engagement on `approver_model_complex`
#                 (falling back to the default tier when unset, the same
#                 escalation-off convention `reviewer_model_complex` uses).
#   adjudication  triggered by refuse-streak, not by complexity — see
#                 `approver_refuse_streak` below — always on
#                 `approver_model_critical` (falling back down the same
#                 chain), regardless of what tier the ordinary grade would
#                 have chosen.
#
# Refuse-wins, structurally: a refusal is posted as a real `REQUEST_CHANGES`
# review from the Approver identity (`approver_post_review`), so GitHub
# itself holds the pull request at `CHANGES_REQUESTED` and the existing
# `review-feedback` source picks it up next cycle exactly as it already picks
# up a human's own `CHANGES_REQUESTED` — no new work source, no new gate. An
# approval is the ordinary `APPROVE` review on the same pull request; this
# file itself never merges anything, at any level (D18's cardinal rule: the
# model never holds merge rights, and neither does the code in this file) —
# landing, where `agent-merges-routine`/`agent-merges-all` actually differ
# from `agent-approves`, is `lib/landing.sh`'s own separate arming step (WI-7,
# requirement 8d), called only after this file's `run_approver_stage` has
# already returned.
#
# The refuse streak is derived from the reviews list itself, read fresh at
# the moment of the decision, the same "ask GitHub, don't keep a private
# count that can drift" discipline `lib/handoff.sh` and `lib/review-gate.sh`
# already apply, and the same move agent-ops#449 made for
# `could_not_request` — a second, independent counter this file might keep
# instead would need its own reconciliation the moment a cycle dies mid-write
# or two nodes touch the same pull request, and the reviews list already
# cannot disagree with itself.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shell options are set here, matching every
# other lib/*.sh — the caller (agent-cycle.sh runs under `set -euo pipefail`;
# a test, `set -uo pipefail`) owns those.
#
# Environment:
#   APPROVER_GH  override `gh` (tests stub it).

# approver_tier_for COMPLEXITY
# Print `trivial`, `standard` or `high` for `low`, `medium` or `high`. Any
# other value — including empty — reads as `standard`, the same
# fail-toward-the-middle-tier caution the resolved `complexity` this reads
# already earned one level up (`reviewer_complexity`'s own raise-never-lower

# The following four functions moved from agent-cycle.sh (#771): the

# exactly as they did inline.
# approver_post_or_warn PR_URL EVENT BODY TOKEN
# `approver_post_review` (lib/approver.sh) returns 0 only on a real 2xx from
# GitHub, and its own header is explicit that a caller must not read a failure
# as a posted review. This is that reading, in one place: a review GitHub
# refused — an expired token, an App whose installation lost review rights, an
# API outage — leaves the pull request exactly as it was, which is the
# harmless half of requirement 8b's "a missing review, never a stranded PR".
# The harmful half would be leaving no trace: every other way this stage can
# fail to post logs a `warning`, so the one failure that happens at the moment
# of the write must too, or an operator reading the log sees an
# `approver-verdict` and no review on the pull request and has nothing to
# connect them. Always returns 0 — the caller's own path is unchanged either
# way.
#
# Reports the write's own success through `approver_last_post_ok` (`1`/`0`),
# reset on every call — the one fact `run_approver_stage` needs to decide
# whether this round's verdict actually reached GitHub before logging it
# (requirement 8c's `posted` field, agent-ops#573): a verdict a human never
# saw a review for cannot have diverged from, or agreed with, anything.
#
# agent-ops#1082: a failed write used to log the same generic "GitHub refused
# the write" whether GitHub rejected the token outright or merely refused
# because the owner's shared REST budget was spent — indistinguishable to an
# operator, and the second case silently dropped a verdict a short wait could
# have delivered. `approver_post_review`'s own `gh` call already goes through
# the rate-limit-aware wrapper (lib/github-limit.sh) when it is sourced ahead
# of this file (every real caller's own order, per that file's header) and
# `APPROVER_GH` is left at its default — but that wrapper commits to exactly
# one wait-and-retry per call, and gives up silently if the reset it saw then
# was not worth waiting for. This is the caller's own second look, taken only
# once the wrapper has already given up: it classifies the diagnostic
# `approver_post_review` just left in `_approver_err_log` via
# `github_limit_kind` (reused, not reclassified) and, only when the cause was
# rate-limiting, tries the same wait/backoff (`github_limit_wait_plan`) once

# approver_escalation_retire PR_URL CAUSE DETAIL
# The other half of requirement 8c's escalation: `approver_escalate` above is
# the only writer of a `pr-<n>-approver-adjudication` issue, and nothing ever
# read it back before this (agent-ops#1215, agent-ops#1202's own instance) —
# an adjudication `land` posted its APPROVE and the pull request went on to
# merge, and the escalation it had raised sat open for eight hours afterward,
# still asking a human to review and merge a pull request that was already
# merged, until they closed it by hand. This closes it the moment the
# pipeline itself can see the disagreement is over, from either of the two
# places that can happen without the human ever touching the issue:
#
#   - CAUSE "land": this round's own adjudication engagement posted an
#     APPROVE that actually reached GitHub — called from run_approver_stage's
#     `land)` branch, immediately after `approver_post_or_warn` confirms the
#     write landed (`approver_last_post_ok`), never on the strength of the
#     verdict alone, which `approver_post_or_warn` always returns 0 for even
#     when the write itself failed.
#   - CAUSE "merged": the pull request has since merged, however that
#     happened — a human's own click, a later automatic landing, or GitHub's
#     merge queue resolving well after this round — called from
#     scripts/sweep-closed-issues.sh's own fleet-wide merged-pull-request
#     listing (requirement 17c), the same "no other site ever notices a
#     human merge" reach that sweep already has for the post-merge
#     closing-keyword backstop.
#
# DETAIL is the one fact the closing comment names — the landing SHA for
# "land", "<login> at <ts>" for "merged". Mirrors approver_escalate's own
# dedup lookup (create_escalation_issue's, requirement 8c) rather than
# reusing that function directly: this finds and closes, never creates, so
# there is no shared call to make. A no-op, logging nothing, when no open
# issue matches — the common case, since most pull requests never escalate
# at all — and equally when the only match is one somebody *reopened* after a
# retirement (`stateReason`, read on the same listing): a human's re-open must
# win, the same answer requirement 34k's own one-shot rule and
# `scripts/sweep-closed-issues.sh`'s `state_reason: "reopened"` check give on

# run_approver_stage PR_URL COMPLEXITY
# D18 WI-5 (requirement 8b): the tiered Approver, engaged once per
# Reviewer-ready round, for every repository whose merge_autonomy is
# currently above `human` (lib/merge-autonomy.sh's own kill-switch-aware
# resolution — the fleet-wide kill switch reads as `human` here exactly as
# everywhere else). Judges the pull request `confirm_pr_ready` has already
# flipped out of draft, and posts a real GitHub review — `APPROVE` or
# `REQUEST_CHANGES` — from the Pullwright Approver's own App identity, never
# from a model-issued `gh` command; the model only ever returns a verdict
# (prompts/approver.md).
#
# Always returns 0, and never touches the PR claim or the draft flag: a
# stage that cannot run, or a GitHub write that fails, costs a missing App
# review, never a blocked pull request — by construction, since every path
# through this function ends in either a best-effort review post or a
# best-effort escalation, and the caller's own `pr-ready` log and
# `release_pr_claim` follow unconditionally regardless of what happened here.
#
# Reports its own outcome through four globals, reset here on every call
# rather than left to whatever a previous pull request's round left behind
# — `approver_stage_verdict` (this round's `verdict`, or empty when the
# stage did not reach one), `approver_stage_adjudicating` (`1` iff the
# refuse streak, not the complexity grade, chose the tier),
# `approver_stage_tier` (D18 WI-12, agent-ops#415: this round's own tier,
# `trivial`/`standard`/`high`/`critical` — `critical` whenever a protected
# path forced it, whatever the complexity grade said), and
# `approver_stage_posted` (agent-ops#988: `true` only once a real GitHub
# review write was both attempted and confirmed — the same condition the
# `approver-verdict` log event's own `posted` field already computes;
# `false` for every other outcome, including a verdict that was reached but
# writes nothing, such as an adjudication `escalate`). `run_landing_stage`
# (D18 WI-7, requirement 8d), called immediately after this function
# returns, is the one reader of the first two: it arms nothing at all unless
# this round's own engagement reached an explicit, non-adjudicating
# `approve` — an adjudication's own `land` does not count, because a
# disagreement settled this round is not the same fact as an engagement
# that agreed the first time. `_landing_stage_attempt`'s own protected-path
# gate (D18 WI-12) is the reader of the third, on the original arming round
# only — a re-arm reads `landing_retry_tier` from the fleet log instead,
# since that round's own `approver_stage_tier` belongs to a process this one
# never was. `_approver_restale_review` is the one reader of the fourth: it
# is the sharper fact that distinguishes a re-review that wrote nothing to
# GitHub from one that could not even be attempted (see its own header
# below). A return value rather than a global would say the same thing,
# but every existing caller of this function already reads nothing from it
# (`run_approver_stage "$impl_pr_url" "$approver_complexity"`, no
# assignment) and a second, unrelated caller could plausibly want the
# verdict without wanting to restructure that call — the same reasoning
# `stage_kill_reason` (set by `run_claude_stage`, read by its own callers)
# already applies to a stage outcome this file needs to carry past its own
# return.

# The restale sweep (requirement 46, agent-ops#682), moved here from

# `run_standdown_checks` (lib/standdown.sh, phase 2.1d), immediately before the
# landing-retry sweep it can feed; it sat beside `_landing_retry_sweep_repo`
# while both were inline, but it is the Approver's sweep — it re-enters
# `run_approver_stage` above, the way that one re-enters `_landing_stage_
# attempt` — so it follows the stage it drives rather than the sweep it
# precedes.
# _approver_restale_review SLUG PR_URL NUMBER BRANCH COMPLEXITY TITLE [MODE]
# Requirement 46 (agent-ops#682), acceptance criterion 1: trigger a genuine
# re-review of PR_URL, reusing `run_approver_stage` itself rather than a
# second copy of its tiering/adjudication/escalation/tech-debt-filing logic —
# the same DRY reasoning `_landing_retry_sweep_repo` already applies to
# `_landing_stage_attempt`. Unlike that function's own ordinary call
# (`run_approver_stage "$impl_pr_url" "$approver_complexity"`, immediately
# after the Reviewer stage in the same cycle that raised or fixed the pull
# request), this call has no live work order, Implementer summary or
# Reviewer summary handed to it by an already-running cycle — the whole
# reason the restale sweep exists is that the cycle which *did* have them
# never reached this point (a stage timeout, a kill, a host failure; "Long-
# running commands" above names this exact failure shape, and it is what
# stranded PR #621 for 13.5 hours). So this function clones the repository
# fresh, checks the pull request's own branch out into it, and builds
# synthetic-but-honest work-order/Implementer/Reviewer JSON that says exactly
# that, then borrows `run_approver_stage`'s own globals for the one call —
# saved and restored around it, never left mutated for whatever this cycle's
# own selected work order does next.
#
# MODE (default `restale`) names which of requirement 46's two triggers is
# asking: `restale` — the original stale-`CHANGES_REQUESTED` re-review — or
# `unreviewed` (agent-ops#890) — a ready pull request the Approver never
# reviewed at all. The mode picks the synthetic work order's item ref,
# source and acceptance prose; everything else — the fresh clone, the
# borrowed globals, the outcome contract — is identical, which is exactly
# why #890's acceptance criterion 2 routes its trigger through this function
# rather than a second copy of it.
#
# Reports its outcome through the global `_approver_restale_review_result`,
# set on every path before this function returns to one of three values —
# `posted` once `run_approver_stage`'s own `approver_stage_posted` confirms a
# real GitHub review write was attempted and succeeded; `unposted`
# (agent-ops#988) once it reached a real verdict that wrote nothing to
# GitHub instead — an adjudication `escalate`, or an unrecognised verdict —
# distinct from `posted` because nothing on the pull request changed, so the
# caller must not treat this the way a genuine write is treated (retrying it
# again immediately would only reach the same verdict, at the same cost);
# and `unavailable` when a verdict could not even be reached: the clone or
# checkout failed, or `run_approver_stage` bailed out before engaging (the
# stage disabled at this level, the credential absent, the streak unreadable,
# no model resolved). `unavailable` is what tells the caller acceptance
# criterion 2's dismissal is the fallback to take instead; `unposted` is what
# tells it to bound further engagement instead of dismissing or retrying
# unconditionally (see `_approver_restale_sweep_repo`'s own header below).
#
# A global rather than something printed for the caller to capture, the same
# signalling `_landing_stage_attempt_armed` uses and for a sharper version of
# the same reason: this function's stdout is not its own. `run_approver_stage`
# ends in `(( ONCE )) && dump_stage_output`, which `cat`s the whole stage's
# result to stdout, so a `--once` run of a caller reading `$(…)` would capture
# the stage output with the outcome word glued to the end of it and route a
# re-review that did post into the dismissal fallback.

# Requirement 46 (agent-ops#682), acceptance criteria 3 and 4: a
# rebase-only-stale Approver review — the head keeps moving, but no commit has
# been authored since the review — retried every cycle with nothing ever
# changing is exactly the "rebase-only cycle masquerading as progress" the
# issue names. Once REVIEW_AT (the standing review's own `submitted_at`,
# which a rebase does not move — never `updatedAt`) is older than
# `approver_restale_escalate_after_hours`, this hands the pull request to a
# human instead of retrying it forever, through the same generic
# `create_escalation_issue` (`enabler_assignee`) every other escalation in
# this file already uses — never a destination this function names itself
# (D18, agent-ops#627/#679).
#
# CAUSE names which of the stale trigger's two bounded branches called, so
# the issue a human opens explains the situation they are actually looking at
# rather than the other one: `rebase-only` (the default, the branch above) or
# `unposted` (agent-ops#988 — a commit *was* authored since the review, it
# *was* re-reviewed, and that re-review reached a verdict it never wrote to
# GitHub). The two differ in every fact that matters to the reader, so they
# get their own "why", and share everything else — the same item ref, the
# same `create_escalation_issue` dedup, the same `approver-restale-escalated`
# event.

# _approver_restale_sweep_repo SLUG LOGIN
# Requirement 46: the fleet-wide sweep that keeps a pull request from
# sitting silently with no live Approver position on it, under two triggers
# sharing one listing. Same shape as `_landing_retry_sweep_repo` immediately
# above: skip a repository the kill switch or a freeze currently holds at
# `human` before any further GitHub call, then walk every open, non-draft,
# `pr_label` pull request.
#
# **Stale trigger** (agent-ops#682) — a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` pull request
# whose Approver review has gone stale: the gap PR #621 fell into for 13.5
# hours before a human dismissed it by hand. The deterministic trigger
# (`approver_review_stale`, lib/approver.sh) is the Approver's own standing
# review (`landing_approver_standing_review_at`, the same fresh read
# `_landing_retry_sweep_repo` and `_landing_stage_attempt`'s own gate 4
# already make) carrying a `commit_id` that no longer matches the pull
# request's current head — never GitHub's `requested_reviewers`, which
# silently no-ops for the Approver's own Bot identity (the exact failure
# `prompts/implementer.md`'s review-feedback section already documents
# best-effort around, and the reason this sweep exists at all rather than
# trusting that call to have worked).
#
# A stale review with a commit *authored* since it was submitted
# (`approver_newest_commit_authored_at`) is genuine progress — a rebase alone
# cannot produce one, since it reuses each replayed commit's own original
# author date — and gets a real re-review (`_approver_restale_review`), whose
# three-way outcome (agent-ops#988) decides what happens next: `posted`
# (acceptance criterion 1's "unaffected" case, criterion 4) needs nothing
# further — a fresh review now stands. `unavailable` falls back to a
# self-dismissal (`_approver_restale_dismiss`, criterion 2) — the re-review
# could not even be attempted. `unposted` — a verdict was reached (most often
# an adjudication `escalate`) but it wrote nothing to GitHub, so the standing
# review is exactly as stale as before — is neither dismissed (the
# adjudicator declined to clear it) nor re-engaged again this cycle
# (`approver_restale_unposted_prior_engagement`, keyed on the standing
# review's own id): the first such outcome is remembered, and only once
# `approver_restale_escalate_after_hours` has passed since it with the review
# still standing does `_approver_restale_escalate` hand the pull request to a
# human (criterion 3) — the same per-review-id-deduplicated path the
# rebase-only branch below already uses, so a human is summoned once, not
# every cycle. A stale review with nothing authored since it is a
# rebase-only push masquerading as one worth reviewing — neither re-reviewed
# nor dismissed, since nothing has actually changed for either action to
# judge — and is left alone until `approver_restale_escalate_after_hours`
# hands it to a human instead (`_approver_restale_escalate`, criteria 3 and
# 4). A pull request a peer node's fleet-wide `pr-<n>` claim currently
# holds (issue #987, TD-PPagop-26082509) — under whatever item ref won it
# there, a `review-feedback` round most often — never reaches any of the
# three: `_approver_sweep_claimed_pr_numbers` is read once for the whole
# pass (shared with the unreviewed trigger below, never fetched twice for
# one repository), and a candidate it names is skipped, logged, and left for
# next cycle exactly as an unresolved source or a truncated listing already
# is.
#
# **Unreviewed trigger** (agent-ops#890) — a ready pull request that carries
# no Approver review at all: the gap PR #828 fell into for days, and #1049
# and #1059 after it. Every other recovery path is keyed on an event or a
# review state (`CHANGES_REQUESTED`, a conflict, a draft, a dequeue, failed
# checks), so a cycle dying between the Reviewer's handoff and the Approver
# — or an Approver verdict whose own GitHub write was refused, or the
# stage's silent fail-closed skip — used to strand the pull request
# permanently rather than for one cycle. This trigger is keyed on the
# *state* instead, exactly as the issue's follow-up analysis asks, so all
# three routes into the gap are recovered by the one path: open, non-draft,
# `pr_label`, `reviewDecision` anything but `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (that one
# belongs to the stale trigger above or to the review-feedback source), no
# standing Approver review at all on the same fresh read the stale trigger
# makes, and `createdAt` older than `approver_unreviewed_engage_after_hours`
# — a ready pull request younger than that is ordinary in-flight work whose
# own cycle's chained Approver stage is still the ordinary path. The
# pipeline's own construction is what makes non-draft the handoff record
# (acceptance criterion 3): an Implementer raises its pull request as a
# draft — the draft *is* its claim marker — and only the Reviewer's handoff
# readies it, so a mid-Reviewer pull request is still a draft and never a
# candidate here. A peer working the pull request right now is excluded by
# the fleet-wide `pr-<n>` claim (criterion 4, `_approver_sweep_claimed_pr_
# numbers`), and the union-log engagement memory
# (`approver_unreviewed_prior_engagement`) bounds the trigger (criterion 5):
# one engagement per head — a `posted` verdict is never re-engaged (the
# write's own retry machinery owns it from there), only an `unavailable` one
# is retried — and once the first engagement at the current head is older
# than `approver_restale_escalate_after_hours` with still no standing
# review, `_approver_unreviewed_escalate` hands the pull request to a human
# instead. Like every count the union log backs, the memory is approximate
# across nodes for one propagation interval; the worst transient outcome is
# a doubled engagement whose second review lands under the same App
# identity, which GitHub folds into one standing position.

# _approver_restale_diff_unchanged SLUG NUMBER BASE OLD_COMMIT BRANCH
# Requirement 46a (agent-ops#1806): sharpens the stale trigger's own
# "genuine progress" test. `approver_newest_commit_authored_at` alone
# cannot distinguish a real fix from a merge-conflicts resolution commit
# that authors fresh (so its date is genuinely newer than the review) but
# introduces no net change — a clean rebase, or a both-sides-kept
# resolution reproduced on the moved base. This asks the diff itself: is
# BRANCH's current head, diffed against BASE, patch-id-identical
# (`rebase_only_push`, `lib/rebase-only.sh`) to OLD_COMMIT — the standing
# review's own pinned commit — diffed against the same BASE? True only when
# it is; a real content change (including a same-region conflict resolved
# by keeping both sides, whose diff necessarily differs from either side's
# own) reports false and takes the ordinary re-review path below.
#
# Needs a fresh, throwaway clone, the same shape and cost as the sweep's own
# `_approver_restale_review` clone below (`$workspace_root/${cycle_id}-…`,
# `assert_in_workspace`, `clone_repo`) — one clone per candidate this branch
# actually reaches, never per candidate the sweep merely lists: OLD_COMMIT
# is not necessarily reachable from any live ref once the pull request has
# moved past it, so a shallow fetch of BRANCH alone would not resolve it.
# Fails closed on any read failure: "could not tell" is never "unchanged",
# since that would silently retire a review nobody has confirmed still
