# lib/toggle.sh — the pipelines' enable/disable switch (requirement 2.3), and
# the fleet flags that lift it and the usage-limit stand-down to every node
# at once (requirements 2.3a and 2.1 — see the fleet section below).
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh, review-cycle.sh, scripts/publish-dashboard.sh and
# scripts/state-sync.sh, so what stops a cycle, what `--status` prints, what
# the dashboard shows and what a node publishes about itself to the fleet are
# one definition rather than four that agree until they don't
# (requirement 34a).
#
# Why this exists: both cron pipelines *execute code out of the agent-ops
# working tree*. An agent editing agent-cycle.sh, lib/, or prompts/ is editing
# the very files the next cron tick will source — a cycle firing mid-edit runs
# half of one revision and half of another, and the resulting failure is
# attributed to whatever the agent happened to be writing. The switch lets an
# agent (or a human) stand the pipelines down for the duration of its work.
#
# The switch is a single file, `state_dir/disabled.json`, holding one record:
#
#   {
#     "disabled_at": "2026-07-17T09:00:00Z",
#     "expires_at":  "2026-07-17T13:00:00Z",   // null means "until --enable"
#     "by":          "wallen@host pid 4242",
#     "reason":      "editing lib/toggle.sh",
#     "actor":       "wallen@host",            // toggle_actor — never "unknown"
#     "kind":        "manual",                 // manual | auto (requirement 2.3)
#     "scope":       "node"                    // node | fleet (requirement 2.3)
#   }
#
# `actor` and `kind` exist because a reader of a stand-down flag must be able
# to tell an operator's deliberate stop from a detector's inference: a probe
# may clear an automatic stand-down early, and must never clear a manual one
# (#244 — the 2026-08-05 operator stand-down whose actor read as a bare
# container id was initially misread as a runaway automatic freeze).
#
# `scope` answers the neighbouring question — *which* decision is this record.
# A fleet-wide `--disable` writes this file too (requirement 2.3a: local
# first, because that always works), so without it the node that issued a
# fleet stand-down is indistinguishable from one an operator deliberately
# stood down alone with `--disable --this-node`. That node wore the
# dashboard's node-scoped `disabled` badge and `--status` announced a
# node-scoped disable nobody had asked for; worse, `--enable` run from
# *another* node clears the fleet flag but cannot reach this file, leaving one
# node down on its own, indefinitely under `--for forever`, blamed on a
# decision that was never made. `scope: "fleet"` marks the record as a
# *mirror* of the fleet switch rather than a stand-down in its own right, and
# every reader of it says so.
#
# A record with no `scope` reads as `node`: that is what every record written
# before this field existed effectively was, and — as everywhere else here —
# it is the reading that keeps a node down rather than one that talks itself
# out of a stand-down.
#
# It lives in `state_dir`, not in the repo, for two reasons: the repo is the
# thing being edited (a switch tracked in git would arrive and depart with
# branch checkouts, and could be committed by accident), and `state_dir` is
# already where this system keeps everything that outlives a cycle.
#
# ## Expiry is the point, not a convenience
#
# A disable defaults to a TTL (`disable_default_ttl`) and only becomes
# indefinite when someone explicitly asks for `--for forever`. This is the
# same defensive shape as the stale-lock rule in requirement 1, and for the
# same reason: the characteristic failure of this system is not a crash, it is
# a silent, confident no-op (see the Gotchas table). An agent that disables the
# pipeline and then dies — killed, timed out, context exhausted, or simply
# finished and forgetful — leaves behind a file that stops every future cycle
# for as long as nobody looks. Nothing would alert; PRs would just stop. A TTL
# turns "forgot to re-enable" from a permanent outage into a few lost cycles.
#
# Everything ambiguous resolves toward *disabled*, never toward enabled: an
# unreadable record, or one whose `expires_at` cannot be parsed, keeps the
# pipeline down. The file exists because something meant to stop the pipeline;
# recovering "enabled" from a truncated write would be the one wrong direction
# — it would run the cycle the switch was set to prevent.

# new work and everything in flight alike, a drain refuses only new work.

# ===== Fleet flags (requirements 2.3a and 2.1) ================================
#
# The switch above stops one node. A fleet of active nodes needs two signals
# that reach all of them at once, without waiting for the next state-sync
# fetch interval:
#
#   fleet/disabled.json — the switch, one level up. Same record shape as
#     state_dir/disabled.json; set and cleared by `agent-cycle.sh
#     --disable/--enable`, which writes both levels.
#   fleet/limit.json — a usage-limit stand-down. Every node spends the same
#     Claude account, so the first node to hit the limit publishes
#     {resume_at, class, reset_known, node, ts} and the rest stop trying.
#     Writers may only ever *extend* resume_at, never shorten it — two nodes
#     hitting the limit in the same minute must converge on the later resume,
#     whatever order their writes land in. `agent-cycle.sh --clear-limit`
#     deletes it instead, which is how a human ends a stand-down early
#     without breaking that rule.
#
# Both live as files on the state repository's main branch, written through
# the contents API — the same CAS the claim registry uses (requirement 17a):
# a PUT with a stale sha loses, and the loser re-reads before retrying. There
# is no single writer and no chore to elect one; every operation here is
# idempotent, so "whoever gets there first" is the whole protocol.
#
# Failure directions, chosen deliberately:
#   404 (flag file) → the flag is clear. Definitive, not an error — for this
#     level's own fail-open flags. The contents API answers "this repository
#     does not exist, or is invisible to this token" with the same 404 as
#     "the flag file does not exist" (TD-PPagop-26081602), and for these
#     flags the collapse is accepted: mistaking an invisible repo for a
#     clear flag fails open, which is their chosen direction anyway. A
#     caller whose flag must not fail open asks fleet_flag_fetch_status for

#
# MODE is a second split the same argument applies to (issue #513, PR #506

# about one underlying GitHub response — a contents-API 404 is `clear` by

# once it fails to confirm the repo is visible (TD-PPagop-26081602). A
# default-mode `clear` memoised first must never be served to a later
# `probe-404` read of the same (NAME, STATE_DIR), or a fail-closed flag's
# whole point is silently disarmed for the rest of the process. No caller
# mixes modes for one name today (verified for both of #506's reviews), but

# fleet_flag_fetch_status STATE_REPO STATE_DIR NAME [MODE] [FRESH]
# fleet_flag_fetch's own body, printing STATUS<TAB>RAW instead of RAW alone —
# STATUS<TAB>RAW travels as one string on stdout, the same compound-return
# idiom lib/review-gate.sh's own functions use. Split it with parameter
# expansion, never `IFS=$'\t' read`, which review-gate.sh can use only because
# both of its fields are single-line: RAW here is a file fetched from the state
# repository, so it holds whatever bytes that file holds, and a `read` would
# silently truncate a pretty-printed record to its first line — leaving the
# caller to read a valid flag as unparseable and lose the operator's own reason
# from `--status` and scripts/doctor.sh. So:
#   status="${combined%%$'\t'*}"
#   raw="${combined#*$'\t'}"
# STATUS is one of:
#   clear        — no state repo configured, or a 404 on the flag file: the
#                  flag does not exist. In the default mode that is the
#                  contents API's word alone, which cannot tell a missing
#                  flag file from a missing-or-invisible repo — accepted for
#                  the fail-open flags (the header's 404 entry). With MODE
#                  `probe-404` a 404 resolves to clear only after
#                  fleet_repo_visible confirms the repo, so the 404 was
#                  definitively the flag file's own (TD-PPagop-26081602)
#   live         — the fetch against the state repo just succeeded
#   cached       — the state repo — or, under `probe-404`, a flag-file 404's
#                  repo probe — was unreachable; RAW is the last
#                  successfully fetched copy
#   unreachable  — the same, with no cached copy at all
# fleet_flag_fetch is a thin wrapper over this that keeps its own RAW-only
# contract byte-for-byte unchanged for its three existing callers
# (fleet_disabled_state, fleet_limit_resume_at, fleet_limit_publish), which by
# design cannot tell "clear" from "unreachable" apart — see the header for why
# that is safe for them. It never passes `probe-404`: that is what keeps the
# contract byte-identical (a flag-file 404 stays terminal, cache dropped) and
# spends no probe call on the fail-open flags' steady state, whose 404 is the
# common case. merge_autonomy_kill_state is the one caller that needs the
# distinction (TD-PPagop-26081507): "clear" and "unreachable" both print an
# empty RAW, but only "unreachable" must make the kill switch fail closed —
# and it is the one caller that asks for `probe-404`, because a fail-closed
# flag mistaken for clear is the exact harm TD-PPagop-26081602 closes.
#
# Memoised (issue #502, PR #499 review follow-up): a `live` or
# `clear` answer — the two GitHub actually confirmed, as opposed to `cached`
# or `unreachable`, which are this process's own uncertainty about a fetch
# that did not complete — is written to `_fleet_flag_memo_file` and read
# back before any network call on every later call for the same (NAME,
# STATE_DIR) in this process. `cached`/`unreachable` are deliberately never
# memoised: they are already a degraded answer, so trying the fetch again
# next call costs nothing extra and might do better, whereas memoising a
# guess would let one bad moment (a transient DNS blip) decide every read
# for the rest of the process instead of just the one call that hit it. A
# flag this process itself writes or deletes drops every state_dir's memo of
# it too (fleet_flag_write, fleet_flag_delete), so a set/clear this same
# process performs is never shadowed by its own earlier read. At most one
# cycle of staleness follows from that for an advisory reader — a human
# toggling the flag from elsewhere is picked up fresh next cycle's process,
# never mid-cycle — which is the same staleness this flag's own polling
# interval already accepts (requirement 2.3a).
#
# FRESH (issue #513, PR #506 review follow-up) is the escape from that
# staleness for a caller taking an outward action under the answer, rather
# than merely computing with it — `run_approver_stage` (agent-cycle.sh) is
# the one site today, and PR #512's arming step needs the identical read. A
# non-empty FRESH skips the memo hit below (this one call only) and always
# talks to `_fleet_gh`, so a kill set from outside this process is seen at
# the moment of decision rather than replaying the cycle's first answer for
# this (NAME, STATE_DIR, MODE). The fresh answer is still written back to the
# memo afterwards — a later, non-fresh, advisory read in the same process
# benefits from it rather than repeating the fetch — so FRESH costs exactly
# one extra request at the acting site itself, never more.
#
# The memo hit is read into a variable, not tested with `[[ -f ]]` and then
# `cat`, and served only if non-empty (issue #513, PR #506 review follow-up):
# the file could vanish between the test and the read, and an interrupted
# write can leave it present but empty, and either way `[[ -f ]] && cat`
# would have returned success with nothing on stdout — an empty STATUS/RAW
# that `merge_autonomy_kill_state` resolves to `{"state":"enabled"}`, the
# same fail-open direction the recycled-PID bug 97539b7 fixed. Falling
# through to a live fetch instead costs one avoidable request in the
# vanishingly rare case the file is merely stale-but-fine, against never
# serving a torn or missing memo as an answer.

# anything else that stops the delete returns non-zero, because "cleared"
# reported for a flag that is still set keeps the whole fleet standing down
# after the operator believes they resumed it. A successful clear also drops
# the local cache — a stale cached copy must not resurrect a flag the fleet no
# longer has.
#
# The read-for-sha's own 404 is the same ambiguous contents-API 404
# `fleet_flag_fetch_status`'s `probe-404` mode resolves for the fetch side
# (TD-PPagop-26081602): it means either "the flag file does not exist" or

# side gets to accept that collapse for its fail-open flags; the delete side
# never can, because "absent" here is a claim that the flag has been cleared,
# not merely that nothing stands the fleet down — so every 404 is probed with
# `fleet_repo_visible`, unconditionally, and only a confirmed-visible repo
# resolves to `absent`. Unlike the fetch side there is no cached copy to fall
