# lib/prompt-overrides.sh — per-installation prompt overrides (issue #79,
# docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md requirement 4a).
#
# `prompts/*.md` are product content: they ship with the image, and a fork
# that edits one directly stops receiving updates to it. config.json's
# `prompt_overrides.<stage>` lets a consumer add or replace a stage's prompt
# without touching `prompts/`, by naming files that live outside it — a
# relative path resolves against `state_dir`, the one location this repo
# guarantees survives an image update or a `git pull` (prompts/*.md does
# not). `extend` (the primary mode) appends one or more files, each wrapped
# with a disclaimer that the installation's specs still outrank it; `replace`
# (sharper, flagged loudly in the README) substitutes a whole file for the
# stage's shipped prompt before any `extend` fragments are appended.
#
# Absent `prompt_overrides` (or a stage missing from it), every function here
# reproduces today's behaviour byte-for-byte: `stage_prompt_text` prints
# exactly `cat prompts/<stage>.md` would. A configured path that is not
# readable is treated the same as absent — a typo must not fail a cycle —
# though it still changes the fingerprint (`stage_prompt_sha`), so a broken
# path is visible as an unexplained fingerprint change rather than silently
# eaten.
#
# `implementer` and `reviewer` — the two stages that already run against a
# single known repository — additionally take a per-repository layer,
# `repos[].prompt_overrides` (`config.schema.json`'s `repoPromptOverrides`),
# on the `stage_timeouts`/`merge_autonomy` precedence: `prompt_overrides_json_for_repo`
# resolves that down to the plain per-stage object every function below
# already takes, so `stage_prompt_text`/`stage_prompt_sha` themselves know
# nothing about repositories at all. The schema restricts a repo's own entry
# to `implementer`/`reviewer` only — every other stage runs across repos or
# ahead of selection and has no one repository to scope an override to — so
# this resolver never has to reject a stage itself; a config that tried would
# already have failed the schema gate before any of this file runs.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh.

# prompt_overrides_json_for_repo CONFIG_JSON SLUG
# The `overrides_json` every function below takes, resolved for one
# repository: SLUG's own `repos[].prompt_overrides` entry layered over the
# installation-wide `prompt_overrides` object, one stage key at a time — a
# stage SLUG's own entry sets wins outright (the whole `{extend, replace}`
# object, not a field-by-field merge of the two), the installation-wide entry
# for that stage otherwise. This is `merge_autonomy_configured_level`'s
# precedence applied per stage key rather than to one scalar, the same
# generalisation `stage_timeouts`/`stage_inactivity` already make for one
# actor's number. With no matching `repos[]` entry, or none carrying
# `prompt_overrides`, this reproduces the installation-wide object exactly —
# byte-identical to reading `.prompt_overrides` directly, so a caller with no
# per-repository entry to resolve never has to special-case that.

# stage_prompt_sha PROMPTS_DIR STATE_DIR STAGE OVERRIDES_JSON
# A digest that changes iff stage_prompt_text's output for STAGE would
# change — for the no-op fingerprint (requirement 3b), which must notice an
# edited or newly-broken override exactly as it notices an edited
# prompts/<stage>.md. Content-addressed: the base file contributes its
# content hash alone, and each configured `extend` entry contributes its
# content hash keyed by its *configured* path — the config.json string the
# fragment heading also serves, so it is already part of the text — with a
# configured-but-unreadable entry recorded explicitly under that same name,
# so a fragment silently going missing busts the fingerprint rather than
# reproducing the same "no work" verdict forever. No resolved filesystem
# path enters the digest: `none-selected` fingerprints are compared
# fleet-wide (requirement 3b reads the shared log), so two nodes serving
# identical prompt bytes from different install paths must compute the same
# fingerprint, and moving an installation without changing a byte of content
# must not bust the short-circuit. A `replace` file becoming readable, or a
# rename, registers exactly when it changes the bytes served — and not when
# it does not.
