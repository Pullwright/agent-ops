# lib/stage-attempt.sh — one Co-Ordinator stage attempt end to end: launch,
# parse the final message (with the prose/fence/bare-object salvage models
# occasionally need), and the shared failure handling — a refused API
# request, a wedged or timed-out run, an unparseable message — that every
# stage this pipeline runs eventually hits.
#
# Split out of agent-cycle.sh (#771) as the "stage orchestration and prompt
# assembly" seam docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md's requirements name:
# `run_coordinator_stage_attempt` is the one launch/parse/salvage sequence the
# Co-Ordinator's first attempt and its corroboration retry both run through,
# `fallback_select_candidate` and `coordinator_corroborate_retry_or_fallback`
# are the requirement-3v ladder built on top of it once a `none-selected`
# verdict fails corroboration, and `extract_json_result`/`stage_salvage_result`/
# `dump_stage_output`/`stage_api_refusal`/`stage_api_refusal_message`/
# `handle_stage_failure` are what every stage — Co-Ordinator, Approver,
# Enabler, Refiner, Implementer, Reviewer — shares to turn a stage's raw
# output into a parsed verdict or a recorded, claim-releasing failure.
#
# Sourced by agent-cycle.sh only; reads and writes the cycle's own globals
# (`cycle_dir`, `ONCE`, `ordered_repos_json`, `selected_repo`/`selected_item`,
# `claim_active`, …) exactly as it did inline, and calls lib/stage-run.sh's
# `run_claude_stage` and lib/stage-budget.sh's `stage_budget_apply`.

# Stage prompts require the final message to be pure JSON, but a model will
# sometimes prepend analysis prose anyway and put the real object in a
# trailing fenced ```json block — or leave it bare after the prose. Try a
# straight parse first; then the last fenced block; then the earliest line
# opening a brace whose text from there to the end of the message parses as
# exactly one JSON value.
#
# The third salvage earns its place by what its absence cost. On 2026-08-03
# an Enabler engagement examined three refinement items, reached a correct
# `escalate` verdict on each and drafted every escalation issue — then ended
# with a summary paragraph, a blank line, and the verdict object, bare. The
# fence fallback could not touch it (the prompts *forbid* the fence, so the
# one deviation this function could rescue was the one the prompts rule
# out), the engagement was discarded whole under requirement 37, and the
# items sat behind its never-released claims for the rest of claim_ttl_hours
# — six further hours — waiting for a retry that could only re-derive what
# the discarded message already said. Prose-then-bare-object is the shape
# models actually produce when they slip; it must not be the one fatal case.
#
# It is deliberately a *suffix* parse: only an object that runs to the end
# of the message is taken, and an object with trailing prose still fails,
# because "which of these is the verdict" is not a question this function
# should answer. `jq -es 'length == 1'` is the single-value check — `jq
# empty` accepts a stream of several values, and a salvage should never be
# looser than the straight parse it backs up.
#
# The fenced-block fallback matches a closing ``` regardless of what info
# string the *opening* fence carried, or whether it carried one at all
# (issue #237): the state machine toggles solely on "is this a fence line",
# not on the literal text `json` following it. A verdict a model fences
# bare — ``` … ``` with no language tag — is not an ambiguous case; only a
# straight parse or a suffix match, not the fence's tag, was ever what told
# a verdict apart from prose. Before this, poetic-2's completed conflict
# resolution of PR #205 (2026-08-07T04:40Z) was discarded for exactly this
# reason — a bare fence the parser could not see — erasing pipeline memory
# that the conflict was fixed and triggering a three-node duplicate-work
# cascade on the same PR.
#
# scripts/publish-dashboard.sh's `extract_status` is a jq port of this
# algorithm and review-cycle.sh carries a bash copy; the three move together
# (docs/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md), and test/extract-json-result.test.sh holds them
# to it.
#
# An empty-or-whitespace-only $text is checked explicitly and fails outright
# (TD26072802, for symmetry with publish-dashboard.sh's extract_status,
# which shares this algorithm per DASHBOARD-SPEC.md): `jq empty` on
# whitespace input succeeds trivially with no output, so without this check
# the function would return 0 — success — while printing nothing. Every call
# site already treats empty output as failure regardless of the exit code, so
# this changes no observable behaviour; it just stops the exit code lying

# Requirement 3v (issue #321): the mechanical last resort once a `none-selected`
# verdict has failed corroboration twice in the same cycle (the original
# engagement and its one retry — see "5. Nothing selected" below). At that
# point liveness must stop depending on the model getting it right at all, so
# the Script itself picks: the highest-priority non-empty source band, its
# first item in repo order, with no per-item judgement applied.
#
# The band order approximates `prompts/coordinator.md`'s own "Selection
# algorithm" — the five cross-repo overrides (security, urgent issues,
# review-feedback, merge-conflicts, abandoned-drafts) ahead of the residual
# bands (human-visibility, high issues, tech-debt, medium issues, low issues,
# code-quality, register-hygiene) — restricted to the bands the Script has a
# pre-fetched array for. Approximates, not mirrors, in two respects a
# mechanical pick can afford: the walk is band-major across the whole fleet
# rather than the Co-Ordinator's repo-then-source walk. `failed-runs`,
# `implementation-plan` and
# `project-review` have no pre-fetched array — enumerating their candidates means a live `gh`
# read or a tree fetch the Co-Ordinator does for itself, which this mechanical
# fallback does not perform — so those three ranks are skipped rather than
# approximated. This is a known, deliberate narrowing: this path exists to
# keep the fleet selecting *something* once the model has twice failed to
# corroborate a `none-selected` against the bands requirement 3x's gate does
# check, so those three sitting
# unreached by fallback costs nothing on the failure mode this exists for —
# `eligible_items_json` is non-empty exactly when the gate can reject a
# verdict at all, and every band it counts has a rank below, so there is
# always something to fall to.
#
# It reads each repo's configured `sources` list as well as its pre-fetched
# arrays, and that is load-bearing rather than tidiness (requirement 3x): the
# arrays alone stopped being the authority on what a cycle may select once
# requirement 2.2a's back-pressure began narrowing the *list* while leaving
# `findings`, `register_hygiene` and `human_visibility` populated. Before 3x
# the point could not arise — back-pressure emptied `tech_debt`, so the
# tech-debt-only gate could never reject during a restricted cycle and this
# function was never reached — but a gate that now counts the finishing
# sources can, and a fallback blind to `sources` would answer it by starting
# fresh work through a full landing gate. The one place the list is coarser
# than the array is `findings`, whose two kinds are separate source tokens
# (`security`, `code-quality`) and are matched as such here.
#
# The one band the gate counts that this walk can still decline is a
# superseded Dependabot merge-conflict entry: the prompt requires it in
# `voided` (so it is eligible, and owed an account) but it is not selectable
# work, so `mc_cands` skips it exactly as the prompt does. A cycle whose only
# unaccounted item is one of those reaches the empty-pick branch below, which
# stands down rather than assuming the guarantee.
#
# Each candidate is built straight from its own pre-fetched entry — the same
# fields the Co-Ordinator's own contract in `prompts/coordinator.md`'s
# "Output" section requires (`item`, `branch`/`pr_url`/`pr_number` for the
# five sources whose branch and pull request predate the claim — the
# `PREFLIGHT_EXISTING_BRANCH_SOURCES` set, `landing-refusals` included — the
# Dependabot `takeover` shape for merge-conflicts) — with `context` a verbatim paste of the entry's own body
# text and `acceptance` a generic instruction naming the source's standard
# procedure, since there is no model here to compose a bespoke one.
# `model`/`model_reason` are supplied by the caller (ordinarily
# `implementer_model_default`) since a mechanical pick makes no model
# judgement to report — cheap to spot on the eventual Implementer work order,
# rather than silently reusing whatever the last attempt happened to prefer.
# `pr_label` is supplied by the caller for the same reason the Co-Ordinator is
# handed it on its runtime input and copies it into every candidate
# (requirement 20): the Implementer labels its draft pull request with the
# work order's own field, and a candidate built here without one would raise
# the unlabelled pull request that no gatherer — nor the back-pressure count —
# can find again.
#
# `refinement_policy` (requirement 39a) binds this path exactly as it binds
# the Co-Ordinator, and for the same reason: a `"required"` source's unrefined
# item is not a lower-ranked candidate, it is one nobody has written a
# specification for yet, and handing it to an Implementer under a generic
# `acceptance` string is precisely the outcome that policy exists to prevent.
# A mechanical picker that ignored it could select what no Co-Ordinator
# engagement was allowed to. So an unrefined item from a `"required"` source
# is dropped here (`mk` yields nothing for it), and a `"preferred"` source's
# refined items are ranked ahead of its unrefined ones within their band —
# the same thumb on the scale `prompts/coordinator.md`'s "Per-source
# refinement policy" section describes, applied by a stable sort so the band's
# own order still decides everything else. `"exempt"` sources, which is every
# source an installation has not opted in, are unaffected.
#
# This costs the guarantee above nothing, band by band: `unaccounted_items`
# drops an eligible entry whose own source is `"required"` before it can ever
# make the gate reject, so a band that could send the cycle here is by
# construction a band this exclusion does not empty.
#
# Prints the single winning candidate object, or `null` if every reachable
# band was empty (never observed in practice, per the guarantee above, but

Your final message a moment ago in this same cycle reported \`\"selected\": false\`
with reason: \"$reason\"

The Script independently counts $eligible_items_total eligible item(s) across
the bands it pre-fetched for you this cycle (unclaimed, unblocked, not void,
and listed in that repo's own \`sources\`). Your verdict accounted for only
$(( eligible_items_total - unaccounted_n )) of them, via \`needs_refinement\`
(under the item's own \`source\`) or \`voided\`. The remaining $unaccounted_n
item(s) were neither selected, reported, nor voided, and are still unaccounted
for, by band:

$unaccounted_refs

This is your one retry for this cycle. Issue a per-item verdict for every item
named above — add it to \`needs_refinement\` (with all five required fields, and
\`source\` set to the band it is listed under above) or to \`voided\` (with
\`evidence\`) — or select one of them, or any other eligible candidate, in
\`candidates\`. Send your entire final message exactly as before: one JSON
object, nothing else.

  # `stand-down`), so a cycle that logged one *and* went on to select would

  # metrics. It is logged below instead, on the one branch where the cycle
