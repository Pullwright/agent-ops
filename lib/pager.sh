#
# lib/pager.sh — fleet-level invariant evaluation, filing and auto-close
# (issue #1278, D21 follow-on to #608's Phase 2 health item).
#
# A registry of named **invariants** — each a pure function over facts every
# node already holds fleet-wide (the union fleet log, every peer's heartbeat,
# this node's own doctor verdict) — evaluated where those facts already
# converge: scripts/publish-dashboard.sh's own WITH_GITHUB tick of the
# Publisher's `*/5` pass (requirement 51 in docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-
# SPEC.md, requirement 20 in docs/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md's Publisher section).
# Exactly one node evaluates a given invariant in a given five-minute window
# — a claim on `<key>__<window>` through lib/claim.sh, the same pseudo-slug
# pattern the Enabler's own `claims/enabler/` uses (see lib/claim.sh's own
# header).
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shell options are set here, matching every
# other lib/*.sh (the caller — scripts/publish-dashboard.sh — owns those).
# Deliberately independent of lib/enabler.sh: the Enabler's own
# `create_escalation_issue`/`create_decision_log_issue` read cycle-scoped
# globals (`cycle_dir`, `enabler_assignee`, `escalation_webhook_url`,
# `node_name`, `cycle_id`) that only exist inside agent-cycle.sh's own
# per-item cycle. The Publisher has no cycle and no item — this file mirrors
# those two functions' behaviour (the same dedup search, the same
# retry-without-label, the same webhook fallback) rather than reaching into
# a stage it does not run as.
#
# `pager_file`/`pager_close` post to the installation's notify channel
# (lib/notify.sh, issue #1279) through `notify_post` — never called directly,
# always behind an `if declare -F notify_post`, so this file stays sourceable
# standalone (test/pager.test.sh does exactly that) whether or not
# lib/notify.sh is alongside it. scripts/publish-dashboard.sh sources both.
# An `if` and not a `&&` list, because the guard has to leave the calling
# function's own exit status alone: a `&&` whose left-hand side fails carries
# that 1 out as the function's result, and a caller running under `set -e`
# then dies on the one path this guard exists to make harmless.
#
# An invariant's lifecycle is event-sourced over the union log, exactly the
# transition-only convention lib/crash-loop.sh's `crash_loop_escalate`/
# `crash_loop_retire_resolved` and lib/decision-veto.sh already settled: a
# firing invariant re-evaluated every five minutes writes nothing new.
# Three transition events:
#
#   pager-candidate {key, first_seen}          firing seen for the first time
#   pager-candidate-cleared {key}               a candidate stopped firing
#                                                 before `pager_min_firing_
#                                                 minutes` elapsed — never
#                                                 announced, so nothing to
#                                                 retract, just a reset to
#                                                 "clear"
#   pager-fired {key, first_seen, evidence, …}  hysteresis elapsed; filed
#   pager-cleared {key, cleared_at, evidence}    the fact cleared; closed
#
# `pager_state_for`/`pager_last_event` derive the current state purely from
# the latest of these four event names for a key — no state file, no cache:
# any node can evaluate any invariant in any window and agree with every
# other node about what has already happened, on the same terms
# `token_expiry_escalated_for` (lib/token-expiry.sh) already does for a
# single-shot escalation.
#
# Remedy classes (the issue's own "Remedy by class"): every firing invariant
# that reaches the hysteresis threshold gets ONE issue per key, in
# `pager_repo`, carrying the fixed `pw::pager` label (lib/labels.sh's
# `escalation` role catalogue) — deduped on the key exactly as
# `create_escalation_issue` dedupes on an item reference, so a second
# evaluation of an already-firing invariant files nothing. What differs by
# class:
#
#   pipeline-act   REMEDY_ARG names a shell function, `REMEDY_ARG KEY
#                  EVIDENCE`, called before filing. It performs the fix
#                  directly (never asks) and prints one line describing what
#                  it did, embedded in the issue body under "## Remedy
#                  taken". The issue itself is filed unassigned — a record,
#                  not a request.
#   config-lever   REMEDY_ARG is prose. The pw::pager issue is filed
#                  unassigned as the tracking record, and a second, separate
#                  `pw::decision` issue is filed via the same
#                  filed-closed-immediately convention
#                  `create_decision_log_issue` (lib/enabler.sh) uses — the
#                  decide-tactical seam's own durable record, complete with
#                  the veto window a human reopening it gives (#937).
#   owner-only     REMEDY_ARG is prose (what the owner must decide). The
#                  pw::pager issue is assigned to PAGER_ASSIGNEE — the load-
#                  bearing half, exactly as for an ordinary Enabler
#                  escalation: assignment is what excludes it from the
#                  `issues` work source (requirement 16.4).
#
# Configuration is read by the caller and handed in as explicit parameters —
# this file has no config_defaults call of its own, so it stays testable
# against a plain fixture with no config.json on disk at all.

# naming which fleet nodes the evidence is about — the dashboard's own node
# card badge (docs/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md) reads it to know which card to mark,
