# lib/token-expiry.sh — the PAT expiry warning (agent-ops#694).
#
# GitHub states a personal access token's own expiry on every
# API response it authenticates, in the `GitHub-Authentication-Token-
# Expiration` response header (e.g. "2026-08-22 09:35:00 UTC"). On
# 2026-08-22 ~09:35Z the fleet's tokens expired with zero warning: every
# node lost GitHub at once, misdiagnosed as an outage (agent-ops#691), and an
# operator noticed only hours later. The expiry date was knowable a month
# out — one header read a day (here, doctor.sh's own existing hourly
# cadence) would have flagged it.
#
# Out of scope: an absent header or a 401 (an already-dead token) is
# agent-ops#691's own territory, handled by `github_auth_probe`
# (lib/github-limit.sh). This file is only the warning before that cliff.
#
# The read and the escalation are deliberately split across two processes
# with different cost budgets: `scripts/doctor.sh` reads the header (a GET,
# its own read-only rule, requirement 2.6a) and writes {expires_at,
# days_remaining} into `.doctor-status.json` once an hour; `agent-cycle.sh`
# reads that file back — no GitHub call of its own — and escalates. This is
# the same split doctor.sh's fails/warns already use with the dashboard
# (`scripts/publish-dashboard.sh` reads rather than recomputes), so the one
# component with an hourly GitHub-call budget to protect is the only one
# that ever spends it.

# How many days' notice is worth a human's attention. Not a config key —
# agent-ops#694's own refinement calls this "a reasonable default, not a
# decision that needs a human" — a fixed constant shared by doctor.sh's own
# warn/ok split and agent-cycle.sh's escalation decision, so the two can
# never drift apart.

# `GitHub-Authentication-Token-Expiration` header value, or nothing if the
# call failed or the header is absent: an installation token, or any other
# credential GitHub states no expiry for. A caller must read
# nothing the same "no evidence" way an unreadable `/rate_limit` snapshot
# already is elsewhere in this file's sibling, never as "expires now".

# `command gh`, matching lib/github-limit.sh's own convention, so a test's
# stubbed `gh` earlier on `PATH` still answers this. Not sourced through
# that file's own `gh` wrapper — this file defines no such wrapper, and
# deliberately does not source lib/github-limit.sh, so that scripts/doctor.sh
# (read-only by its own declared contract) can source this file without also
# picking up a wrapper that waits out and retries refusals.

# token_expiry_parse HEADER_VALUE [NOW_EPOCH]
# Prints "<expires_at ISO-8601 UTC>\t<days_remaining>" for a raw
# `GitHub-Authentication-Token-Expiration` header value, or nothing (and a
# non-zero exit) if it cannot be parsed as a date — which a caller must read
# the same "no evidence" way an absent header already is, never as an
# expiry of zero. `NOW_EPOCH` is exposed for tests to pin the clock; a real
# caller omits it and gets the wall clock.
#
# `days_remaining` floors toward zero rather than going negative: a token
# already past its own expiry has stopped authenticating at all, which
# `github_auth_probe` already reports (agent-ops#691's own territory, not
# this file's) — so a token with six hours left reads 0 days, not 1 and
# never -1, because "under the warning threshold" must not read a same-day
# expiry as still safe.
#
# Always newline-terminated on success, for the same reason
# `github_auth_probe` (lib/github-limit.sh) is: a caller reads this with
# `IFS=$'\t' read -r a b < <(token_expiry_parse …)`, and `read` reports
# failure — though it still populates both variables — for a final line
# with no trailing newline. A caller must not mistake that for "could not
# parse" and discard values that actually parsed fine.
