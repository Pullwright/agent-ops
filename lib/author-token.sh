# lib/author-token.sh — GitHub App installation-token minting for the forge
# authoring App (D18 decision 1, agent-ops#607 Phase 2).
#
# This is the identity every authoring act runs under when it is
# configured — cloning a target repository, pushing a branch, opening or
# commenting on a pull request or issue, reading a repository's contents —
# replacing the owner's own long-lived personal access token with short-lived
# installation tokens minted from a second, distinct GitHub App
# ("Pullwright Author", never the Pullwright Approver — a single identity
# able to both author and approve its own work would recreate the
# self-approval D18 already exists to retire). See lib/forge-auth.sh for how
# a cycle actually selects between this identity and its degrade path.
#
# A thin wrapper over lib/github-app-token.sh's shared minting mechanics —
# the three-step dance, its fail-closed contract, and its tmpfs-only cache
# guarantee are all specified there, not repeated here. It is the same
# generalisation lib/approver-token.sh was rebuilt on by this same item, so
# both identities share one implementation and one set of tests for the
# mechanics themselves.
#
# Four environment variables carry this identity, the same shape
# lib/approver-token.sh's own four already established:
#
#   PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_APP_ID              the App's numeric id
#   PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_INSTALLATION_ID     the default installation's numeric id
#   PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_INSTALLATION_IDS    per-owner installation ids (JSON map)
#   PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH    path to the App's .pem private key
#
# All optional, and this file degrades rather than bricks a node when
# they are unset or unreadable: `author_token_credential_present` returning
# false, or a mint attempt failing, is exactly the "gate unreadable" contract
# `lib/github-app-token.sh` already specifies, and lib/forge-auth.sh's
# `forge_auth_effective_gh_token` treats both the same way — fall back to the
# node's own `GH_TOKEN`, exactly as every cycle has always authenticated
# before this item. No node bricks over this identity being unconfigured; the
# owner-PAT path keeps working unchanged.
#
# One App, several installations — the same problem agent-ops#913 answered
# for the Approver, answered here the same way (decision #921, "one JSON
# map"), so that provisioning the App (agent-ops#1083, an owner act) cannot
# break authoring into the other organisation. A GitHub App installation is
# per account, and since the 2026-09-07 re-homing this fleet's own
# repositories span two of them — `repos[]` naming `Poetic-Poems/poetic`,
# `Poetic-Poems/poetic-fiddle` and `Pullwright/agent-ops`, `state_repo`
# `Poetic-Poems/agent-ops-state`, `crash_loop_repo` `Pullwright/agent-ops` —
# so one installation id can no longer back every repository this identity
# authors into.
# `PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_INSTALLATION_IDS` is a JSON object mapping owner to
# installation id (`{"Pullwright": 12345678, "Poetic-Poems": 87654321}`);
# `author_token_installation_for_owner` resolves it by the owner half of a
# slug, case-insensitively, falling back to the scalar
# `PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_INSTALLATION_ID` for an owner the map does not name. A
# single-owner fleet sets only the scalar, exactly as before, and never needs
# the map at all.
#
# Unlike lib/approver-token.sh's own resolver, an **empty owner** here
# resolves to the scalar default rather than to nothing. The difference is
# not cosmetic: every Approver call site holds a repository slug by
# construction, so an empty one there can only be a caller error, whereas
# this identity's busiest caller — lib/gh-shim.sh's `gh_shim_resolve_token`,
# which runs on every single `gh` and `git` credential fill — legitimately
# cannot name an owner for some invocations (`gh auth status`, `gh api user`,
# a bare `gh api rate_limit`). The scalar is precisely the operator's
# declared answer to "when you cannot tell, use this one", and refusing it
# would degrade every such call to the PAT on a fleet that had configured an
# App perfectly well.
#
# Rejected here for the same reason lib/approver-token.sh rejects it:
# deriving the installation from `GET /app/installations` with the App JWT.
# The installation id is an operator *declaration* of where this identity may
# act, and a lookup would let an installation added on any account silently
# widen the fleet's reach.
#
# Unlike lib/approver-token.sh, there is no config.json declaration to
# reconcile this identity's App id against: nothing in config.json gates on
# knowing it ahead of time (the Approver's `approver_app_id` exists
# specifically to gate `merge_autonomy`, which this identity does not touch),
# the same reason GH_TOKEN itself has no config.json key either.
#
# Sourced, never executed: it sets no shell options, so a caller's own
# `set -euo pipefail` (agent-cycle.sh, deploy/docker/entrypoint.sh) decides.
#
# Environment overrides, for tests only: AUTHOR_TOKEN_CURL, AUTHOR_TOKEN_OPENSSL
# (stub binaries) and AUTHOR_TOKEN_CACHE_DIR (an alternative tmpfs — a
# non-tmpfs directory is refused, so the override cannot re-introduce disk).

# the scalar through here, so a configuration typo can never be *carried* —
# only fallen back from, or reported as gate-unreadable. The three things
# that break on an unchecked id are set out in full in lib/approver-token.sh's
# own copy of this check: a 404 that reads as "GitHub did not issue a token"
# rather than as the typo it is, a cache-key collision between two distinct
# malformed ids (github-app-token.sh's `_github_app_token_cache_file` folds
# every [^0-9A-Za-z_-] to `_`), and `*`/`@` expanding as every element when a

# author_token_installation_for_owner OWNER

# against PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_INSTALLATION_IDS (a JSON object of owner to
# installation id), falling back to PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_INSTALLATION_ID for an
# owner the map does not name — and for no owner at all. Prints the resolved
# id and returns 0, or prints nothing and returns 1 if neither names it.
#
# An **empty OWNER** skips the map and resolves straight to the scalar
# default: see this file's header for why this identity's answer to "no owner
# in play" differs from the Approver's.
#
# A map that is set but not valid JSON, or not a JSON object, is treated the
# same as an empty map (falls straight through to the scalar default) rather
# than raised as an error here — malformed configuration is exactly what
# scripts/doctor.sh exists to catch before this ever runs against it, and a
# minting path failing closed on a config typo would turn a doctor `fail`
# into a mint failure with a much less specific diagnosis. A malformed
# *value* under a well-formed map key falls through the same way, and for the
# same reason: `null`, an object or an array stringifies to a non-empty token
# that would otherwise shadow a perfectly good scalar default, turning a
# fallback into a permanent mint failure for that one owner.
