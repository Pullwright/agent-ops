#
# lib/candidate-gather.sh — the repo-ordering/candidate-gathering loop and
# the skip-list (blocked/void) extracts built on top of it, moved out of
# agent-cycle.sh (#771) as the seam directly ahead of the requirement-4i
# fit machinery: `gather_ordered_repos` orders every configured repo by
# effective staleness (lib/repo-order.sh) and, for each, runs every
# pre-fetched source's gather script, folding claims, first-seen state and
# per-repo entries into `ordered_repos_json`/`source_states_json`/
# `claimed_json`/`unvoid_requests_json`/`hand_flagged_refinements_json`.
# `compute_skip_lists` reconciles the two label-driven human overrides
# (`unvoid` and hand-flagged `needs_refinement`) against that cycle's own
# claim, then derives `blocked_json`/`void_json`, the skip-lists everything
# downstream (eligibility, the Enabler's threshold, the Co-Ordinator's
# input) reads.
#
# Both are pure moves out of agent-cycle.sh's own top-level script body —
# never before functions, so their bodies keep the exact original
# indentation (including column-0 `if`/`while` blocks) rather than being
# reformatted as a function's own — reading and writing the cycle's own
# globals (`cycle_dir`, `union_log`, `repos_json`, …) exactly as they did
# inline. Several test/*.test.sh files lift specific lines out of this file
# by literal pattern, the same way they did out of agent-cycle.sh before
# the move; only the file path changed for them.

# _repo_order_default_branch SLUG
# Print `default_branch<TAB>commit_ts` for SLUG's default branch and its tip
# commit's own committer date — one GraphQL query (agent-ops#1085) replacing
# the two REST reads `gather_ordered_repos`'s own repo-ordering walk used to
# make of every configured repository, every cycle, on every node:
# `repos/<slug>` for `.default_branch`, then `repos/<slug>/commits/
# <default_branch>` for `.commit.committer.date`. Measured live, 2026-08-31,
# against this repository's own `Poetic-Poems/agent-ops`: `rateLimit{cost}`
# on the identical selection set reports 1, against 2 REST `core` points the
# predecessor always paid per repository — the lopsidedness agent-ops#1085
# exists to correct (95 REST refusals fleet-wide in the 48 hours to
# 2026-08-30, against `graphql` sitting at 1513 of 5000).
#
# A single-repository query, deliberately, rather than one call aliasing
# every configured repository at once (which the issue's own text
# considers): `scripts/check-graphql-drift.sh` discovers documents by a
# static text search for the literal `-f query='` form (its own header,
# "DISCOVERY IS A SEARCH, NEVER A LIST"), and an aliased query has to be
# assembled per cycle from however many repositories are configured — no
# fixed literal document exists in this file's own source for that search to
# find, so a file calling `api graphql` that way fails the checker's own
# "no document could be read from it" rule outright, the false-negative this
# checker exists to remove reintroduced by the very migration meant to guard
# against it. This form keeps the fixed, literal `-f query='...'` shape every
# other migrated read-set in this issue uses, at the cost of one call per
# repository rather than one call for all of them — still a strict
# improvement (1 GraphQL point replacing 2 REST points, per repository) and
# the one shape this checker can actually verify against GitHub's live
# schema. agent-ops#1084 (conditional REST caching) is where a batched or
# further-optimised alternative belongs if the fleet's own repository count
# ever makes the per-repository cost worth avoiding.
#
# Prints nothing and returns non-zero — never a guessed value — when the read
# fails for any reason: bad arguments, an unreachable API, a repository
# GitHub cannot resolve, or a response missing either field. The caller
# retains its own pre-existing fallback (`main`/epoch) and its own
# `guard_warn`, exactly as it did for either REST call failing before this
# migration (TD-PPagop-26081407) — this function draws no distinction
# between "the branch was unreadable" and "the tip commit was", the same
# granularity its two REST predecessors already had between them collapsed
# into one call.

# Human-visibility hygiene, requirement 38e — the read-back half of
# tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26080801.md's fix: a violation requirement 38c's sweep
# could not self-heal (logged above as a `warning`) is read back out of
# `union_log`, re-verified live by scripts/gather-human-visibility-hygiene.sh
# (a stale or already-resolved one is dropped there, never here), and — where
# one survives — assigned into that repo's own `human_visibility` array. Its
# own source (issue #284's decision 2), never register-hygiene's: a violation
# here means finished work is invisible to the human whose merge everything
# waits on, ranked immediately after `merge-conflicts` (config.schema.json),
# the same "finishing beats starting" class as the four sources around it —
# register-hygiene's cosmetic-repair, last-place rationale does not describe
# it. Assigned, not appended: unlike `register_hygiene` above (which two
# passes can each contribute to — the plain gather and the void
# re-derivation) this array has exactly one writer, so there is nothing a
# plain assignment could clobber. Only for repos whose `sources` actually
# list `human-visibility`, and only for repos this reduction found a
# violation for at all — everywhere else costs nothing beyond the one
# reduction over `union_log` below, already read once each for `blocked_json`
# and `void_json` above.
#
# ...with one addition (agent-ops#646): a repo carrying *unretired
# `human-visibility-<hash>` void residue* is walked too, even with no live
# violation of its own. That is the only case in which the walk's own "found a
# violation for it" test and requirement 34n's liveness rule want opposite
# answers — the rule needs a definite "this repo yields no such ref this
# cycle", and a repo the walk skipped leaves no `.ok` marker to say so, which
# `void_liveness_actioned` reads as ungathered and declines to decide on
# forever. It is exactly the bound the `failed-run` shape's own extra fetch
# takes further down, and it is free: with no violations to re-verify,
# scripts/gather-human-visibility-hygiene.sh makes no `gh` call at all and
# prints `[]` on the empty input, which is the definite answer the rule was
# missing. `hv_finding_n` of `0` then skips the assignment below, so a repo
# added by this clause contributes a marker and nothing else — it can never
# manufacture a candidate.
human_visibility_json="$(human_visibility_violations "$union_log")"
# The reduction's own validity gate, and the reason it is a gate rather than a

# failed to read would mint an `.ok` marker over an emptiness we never
# established — the one way the marker could lie. So an unreadable reduction
# walks nothing at all, exactly as it did before agent-ops#646 widened the

# Requirement 34n: retire every void entry that is both fully actioned and
# old enough out of `void_json` before anything else reads it — from here on
# `void_json` *is* the bounded extract, reassigned rather than shadowed under
# a new name so every consumer below (the Refiner's candidate filter, the
# no-op fingerprint, the Co-Ordinator's own input) sees it with nothing to
# remember. This is what stops the extract growing without bound: on
# 2026-08-12 it reached 122 entries and 133,615 bytes — past `MAX_ARG_STRLEN`
# — because nothing before this requirement ever retired an entry once it was
# actioned; the only way one left the set at all was a human's hand-appended
# `unvoided` (issue #309).
#
# The 34k sweep and the 34l register-hygiene pass above saw the extract with
# *recorded* retirements already subtracted (the block where `void_json` is
# first computed), but not the ones this block is about to decide — and
# neither needs those either, being already safe to run against an
# item this rule would go on to retire — 34k's own `void_object_closed_items`
# gate already skips a closed object, and 34l's register-hygiene repair has
# nothing left to do once the row already reads `resolved`/`not-debt`, which
# is exactly the state this rule requires before it will retire a register
# void at all. `unvoid_clearances_json`, computed earlier from `void_items`
# directly, is unaffected for the same reason `void_items` itself is: neither
# this reassignment nor requirement 34c's own semantics change — a void stays
# void forever, on the raw log, for every reader that recomputes it there
# (`open_blocked_items`, `enabler_eligible_items`, `refinements_map`, and the
# monitoring dashboard's own use of `void_items`). Retirement narrows only
# what this one cycle goes on to hand somebody, never what counts as void.
#
# "Actioned" is built from six signals, none of them needing a `gh` call this
# rule does not already budget for:
#
#   - an issue or pull request GitHub itself confirms closed
#     (`void_object_closed_items`, re-read here — a pure function over the
#     union log already in memory, costing nothing);
#   - a tech-debt register row whose own file says `status: resolved` or
#     `status: not-debt` — 34i's own "the work is gone" statuses, read by a
#     further `gather_register_status` call per repo with still-unretired void
#     register ids, alongside the one 34i already makes for that repo's
#     blocked ones — the recorded subtraction above is what keeps that
#     residue, and so this read, bounded;
#   - liveness, for the six shapes the cycle already gathers as structured
#     data each cycle (TD-PPagop-26081303, extended by TD-PPagop-26081409):
#     a `dependabot-alert-<n>`/
#     `code-scanning-alert-<n>`, a `register-hygiene-<hash>`, either
#     merge-conflicts shape (`pr-<n>-conflict-<head-sha>`, which requirement
#     34k deliberately excludes from its own close, and
#     `pr-<n>-superseded-<head-sha>`, which it closes — same gather, so the
#     same test decides both), a `pr-<n>-dequeued-<head-sha>` (requirement 3z,
#     excluded from 34k's close for the same reason as the conflict shape), or
#     a `failed-run-<…>` is
#     actioned once its id is absent from this cycle's own gather for that
#     source, and that gather succeeded (`void_liveness_actioned`,
#     lib/void-liveness.sh) — read off the same tee files the repo loop
#     already wrote for the first four, and one further
#     `gather_workflow_basenames` call per repo with still-unretired
#     `failed-run-` void ids for the fifth; and
#   - a merged pull request, for a project-review ref, or a checked task-list
#     box, for an implementation-plan task id — the same on-demand readers
#     34i already calls for the blocked set (`gather_review_status`,
#     `gather_plan_status`), read here for the void residue
#     (`void_review_plan_actioned`, lib/void-liveness.sh); and
#   - the configuration itself, for the residue none of the four above can
#     reach (`void_config_actioned`, lib/void-liveness.sh; PR #340 review):
#     liveness needs the source's own successful gather, and a source is
#     gathered only for a repo whose `sources` still list it, so a repo that
#     drops `merge-conflicts` — or `security`, or `register-hygiene` — freezes
#     every void of that shape it had already minted, and a repo dropped from
#     the config altogether freezes every shape but the closed-object one.
#     Both are read straight off `all_repos_json`, which costs nothing and is
#     deliberately the *unnarrowed* array: `repos_json` carries `--repo`'s
#     filter, under which every other repo would read as dropped, and
#     `ordered_repos_json`'s own `sources` are rewritten by back-pressure
#     (step 2.2a, further down) to the four finishing sources.
#
# Age-only retirement for the six liveness shapes was considered and
# rejected: a void whose id is *still being gathered* — a still-open alert, a
# register-hygiene finding the register still has, a workflow still failing, a
# PR still conflicted — is doing live suppression work every cycle, and
# retiring it on age alone would re-expose the item to be rediscovered void
# all over again, the exact rediscovery churn requirement 34k exists to stop.
# That objection does not reach the config signal: it needs the item to be
# re-offered, which needs a human to re-add the source or the repo, at which
# point one rediscovery pass is the correct behaviour of a newly-enabled
# source and is bounded by what is still live at that moment.
# A void naming no repo (the hand-appended form requirement 34c allows) never
# matches any of these six signals, so it is left, as it always was, for a
# human to retract.
#
# Each entry this block retires is recorded as a `void-retired` event —
# `{repo, item, void_ts, by}`, a fact rather than a state exactly as
# `void-object-closed` is (requirement 34k) — which is what makes the
# decision durable: the subtraction where `void_json` is first computed reads
# those events back, so a settled id is never re-evidenced or re-decided, and
# the register read here stays proportional to the unretired residue instead
# of growing by one id per void ever retired. The recording is skipped on
# --dry-run, like the 34k sweep itself — it is a durable mark on the log —
# while the in-memory narrowing still applies, so a dry run sees the extract
# a real one would.
#
# All of it is behind the `> 0` gate, because the register read is the whole
# cost of this requirement and `void_retire_after_days` of `0` disables the
# requirement: an installation that has switched retirement off must not go
# on paying for the evidence retirement would have needed.
