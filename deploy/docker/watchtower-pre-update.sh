# deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh — make an image roll wait for the
# cycle it would otherwise kill.
#
# Updating a container means destroying it and creating a new one, and
# destroying the scheduler kills the process group its cycle runs in: an
# Implementer dies mid-edit, its clone is orphaned under `workspace_root`, and
# any branch or draft pull request it had already pushed is left behind. The
# pipeline itself heals — the lock is taken over as stale on a later tick and
# the claim GC releases what the dead cycle held — but nothing cleans up that
# debris, and the half-finished work is simply lost.
#
# So the roll waits instead. watchtower runs this script *inside* the container
# it is about to update (`docker exec`, via `sh -c`) and reads its exit status:
#
#   exit 75  (EX_TEMPFAIL) — cancel this container's update; try again on the
#            next poll. Nothing is lost: the newer image is still in the
#            registry and the next poll finds it.
#   exit 0   — nothing is running here; roll away.
#
# "Running" is deliberately the *same* judgement `acquire_lock` makes in
# agent-cycle.sh and review-cycle.sh: a lock file naming a live pid, younger
# than that pipeline's `lock_stale_after`. Taking only "live pid" would let one
# wedged process veto every update for as long as it survived; bounding it by
# the same staleness the next cycle uses means the hook can never defer past
# the point where a cycle would have taken the lock over anyway.
#
# That bounds **one** deferral, and only one. It does not, by itself, bound
# the sequence. Each poll is answered independently, so a node whose next
# cycle starts before watchtower's next poll is never *asked* at a moment
# when the lock is free: every individual refusal is correct, every one is
# well inside `lock_stale_after`, and the node still never rolls on this
# check alone. Nothing here is wedged and nothing here self-corrects — that is
# `roll-pending`'s job, below.
#
# Measured on VM1, 2026-08-24: `Failed=3 Scanned=3 Updated=0` every five
# minutes for hours. One of the two nodes sharing that host happened to be
# polled during a gap between cycles and rolled; its neighbour kept missing
# the gap and stayed on an image ninety minutes older, with nothing anywhere
# saying so. This earlier read the other way — "the worst case is therefore
# `lock_stale_after` hours of deferral, not 'until somebody notices this node
# stopped updating'" — which holds only for a *wedged* cycle. Reporting the
# repeated `Failed` is agent-ops#603; a *healthy* node that simply never gets
# a gap is agent-ops#1096, fixed by the `roll-pending` marker below. The real
# bound today is therefore two-part: one cycle's length for a healthy node
# (agent-cycle.sh's own cleanup() yields its next chain and writes
# `roll-pending` the moment `image_drift_status` reads "behind" — requirement
# 39, requirement 2.5), and `lock_stale_after` hours only for a cycle that is
# actually wedged, which never reaches that cleanup path at all.
#
# **`roll-pending`** (`$state_dir/roll-pending.json`, `{"until": <ISO8601>}`)
# is how the healthy-node bound is actually delivered rather than merely
# hoped for. Declining to chain releases the lock, but the gap that leaves is
# no wider than the moment before the next cron-fired cycle reacquires it —
# still too narrow for a five-minute poll to reliably land in. So
# agent-cycle.sh's cleanup() writes this marker instead of relying on that
# gap: read below, once `lock.json` itself is found held, it overrides that
# one deferral as an unconditional allow until `until` — wide enough
# (`schedule.cycle_interval_minutes`) to guarantee the next poll falls inside
# it, whatever the lock says. Past `until`, with no marker at all, or against
# `review-lock.json`, the ordinary lock-based judgement applies exactly as it
# always has — see "Scope", below, for why the override stops at `lock.json`.
# agent-cycle.sh's own `acquire_lock` also clears a marker that has already
# done its job (agent-ops#1102): once `image_drift_status` no longer reads
# "behind", the next cycle to reacquire the lock removes it before running
# its own stages, so a marker written for one roll cannot linger to authorise
# a later, unrelated one across the cycle boundary it was never asked about.
#
# **Scope.** Only `lock.json`'s own deferral is overridden. `review-lock.json`
# defers exactly as before, marker or not (agent-ops#1102): review-cycle.sh
# never wrote this marker and never decided to yield anything, so a project
# review beginning just after a yielding implementation cycle must not run
# any part of itself under a licence to be destroyed that it never earned.
#
# Both pipelines count toward the ordinary, marker-free judgement below.
# agent-cycle.sh holds `lock.json` and review-cycle.sh holds
# `review-lock.json`, and either dying to a roll costs the same — the marker
# just does not extend to the second of them.
#
# One thing acquire_lock never has to think about: *which container* wrote the
# lock. This script must — watchtower runs it in every container carrying the
# label, and on a tailnet node the dashboard shares the scheduler's state
# volume, so it reads the scheduler's locks. A pid is only meaningful inside
# the PID namespace that minted it, and `kill -0` from any other container
# answers a question about the wrong process. That is not theoretical: on
# 2026-07-28 the dashboard read the scheduler's live lock, found pid 55423
# dead in its own namespace, exited 0 — and that put the image the two share
# into watchtower's restart map, which is keyed by image id, so watchtower
# tried to recreate the very scheduler it had just agreed to defer. Only the
# name conflict with the never-stopped container saved the cycle (#130).
#
# So the lock records the hostname of the container that wrote it, and the
# rule here is:
#
#   - our own lock ($HOSTNAME matches): judge liveness with `kill -0`, exactly
#     as acquire_lock would;
#   - anyone else's (the host differs, or an old lock carries no host): the
#     pid is unanswerable from here, so honour the lock — fail *closed*,
#     bounded by the same staleness as everything else. The asymmetry is
#     priced: honouring a lock whose process is actually gone defers this
#     container's roll until the next cycle takes the leftover lock over (the
#     lock is acquired before the stand-down checks, so every node clears it
#     within the hour; `lock_stale_after` bounds even a node whose cron is
#     dead), while trusting a foreign `kill -0` kills live cycles — and pid
#     collisions make it wrong in both directions, since an unrelated local
#     process at the same number would defer for a cycle that ended hours ago.
#
# The judgement is reimplemented here rather than sourced from lib/toggle.sh on
# purpose: this is the one script in the tree that runs from outside the
# pipeline, on a container that is about to be destroyed, and its answer must
# not depend on anything more than bash, jq and config.json.
#
# Requires `WATCHTOWER_LIFECYCLE_HOOKS=true` on the watchtower service and the
# `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.lifecycle.pre-update` label on each container
# to be protected — both in deploy/docker/compose.yaml.
#
# Usage: watchtower-pre-update.sh [CONFIG_FILE]   (the argument is for tests;
# watchtower invokes it bare and it defaults to /app/config.json).

# 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) will not prevent watchtower from updating the container", as
# its documentation puts it. So a hook that fails does not hold the roll back;
# it is logged and ignored, and the cycle dies exactly as if there were no hook.
#
# Which is why the fail-open branches below still exit 0 rather than erroring:
# not because a non-zero status would freeze the node's image — it would not —

# record_verdict allow|defer — append this invocation to the durable ledger
# lib/updater-health.sh reads back (agent-ops#603), keyed by $HOSTNAME exactly
# as the locks above are: the dashboard and scheduler containers on a tailnet
# node share this state volume but not an identity, so a shared file would mix
# their invocations the same way an unstamped lock once did (#130). $HOSTNAME
# does not, however, tell one *generation* of the same service from the next:
# watchtower clones `Config.Hostname` forward when it recreates a container
# (agent-ops#1072), so a roll's replacement keeps appending to the very same
# file its predecessor wrote to, under the same name. Each line therefore also
# carries `started` — *this* invocation's own PID 1 start time, taken from
# field 22 of `/proc/1/stat` (clock ticks since the host booted), `null` when
# unreadable — which lib/updater-health.sh compares against its own live
# reading of the same value to tell "I wrote this line" from "my predecessor
# did". Two other readings of "when did this container start" are deliberately
# not used: `/proc/uptime` is the *host's* uptime under Docker, not this
# container's; and `stat -c %Y /proc/1` is the procfs inode's mtime, which the
# kernel sets when that inode is *instantiated* — first lookup after a cache
# miss — not when the process started, so it moves whenever the dentry is
# reclaimed and re-created (measured on poetic-1: `stat -c %Y /proc/1` read
# 2h25m later than PID 1's real start). A discriminator that can change under
# one container fails exactly one way — the reader stops recognising its own
# entries and reads `rolled` — which silently retires the `stuck` alarm this
# ledger exists to raise. Field 22 is fixed for the life of the process, needs
# no `procps` in the image, and is strictly ordered across generations, since
# a replacement always starts after what it replaced. Each line also carries
# `service` (`AGENT_OPS_SERVICE`, "unknown" if
# unset) — the compose service this container runs as — so a reader with no
# ledger entry of its own can tell a same-service predecessor's roll from an
# unrelated sibling service's ledger sharing this same directory.
#
# Best-effort throughout (`|| return 0` at every step): a failure to write
# must never change the hook's exit status, and must not add materially to the
# one-minute pre-update-timeout, which fails *open* — a container too slow to
# answer is rolled regardless. `started` follows the same rule: an unreadable
# `/proc/1/stat` writes `null` rather than aborting the line, since a ledger entry
# with no identity is still worth more than no entry at all (the caller
# already treats a missing `started` as unable to support an identity
# verdict). The trim and prune below run only after an "allow": they cost
# several more subprocesses than the defer path — on the roll's own critical
# path, ahead of `exit 75` — can safely spend against that budget. A long
# defer streak still grows this file only slowly, one line per
