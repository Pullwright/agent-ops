# Monitoring Dashboard — as-built specification

Companion to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` (the pipeline spec). This document
describes the local monitoring dashboard **as built**: what it is, the state
it reads, how it is assembled, and the decisions behind it. Use it to
understand, modify, or regenerate the dashboard — and keep it accurate: any
change to the dashboard lands together with the edit that keeps this
document describing what actually exists (see `CLAUDE.md`, "As-built
specifications"). Where it says "requirement N", it means requirement N of
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`.

## What it is

A single-page dashboard for watching and debugging the autonomous agent
pipeline: current status, usage-limit stand-downs, open agent PRs and their
CI, recent cycles with per-stage cost/duration/model, failures, blocked and
void items, the work sources the Co-Ordinator sees, spend by day, by model and
by actor, which version each node is running, the raw log, and each stage's
transcript inline.

Three properties are deliberate and non-negotiable:

- **Local and private.** Nothing is published anywhere. The site is generated
  onto local disk and opened in a browser. There is no server and nothing
  listening on a network address (an optional loopback-only server exists
  purely as a `file://` fallback), and no GitHub Pages. The pipeline's
  operational telemetry — costs, cadence, failure detail, agent reasoning —
  never leaves the machine except, when the optional tailnet access documented
  in the README is installed, to the owner's own signed-in devices:
  `tailscale serve` proxies the unchanged loopback server over the owner's
  private tailnet, and nothing ever gets a public URL.
- **Free to run.** The generator is `bash` + `jq` + `gh` on the existing cron
  cadence; the page is a static file; there are **no model calls anywhere**.
- **A reader, never a participant.** It only reads the pipeline's state and
  GitHub. It never writes into the state tree, never touches the lock, and
  cannot slow or disturb a running cycle. It redacts home paths and
  token-shaped strings so a screenshot is safe to share.

## Architecture

                                           scripts/gather-findings.sh)
        │                                        │
        └────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                     ▼
        scripts/publish-dashboard.sh   (the Publisher)
          → <state_dir>/dashboard/data.js   (redacted JSON, generated)
          → <state_dir>/dashboard/stamp.js  ({generated_at, fingerprint})
          → <state_dir>/dashboard/index.html (copied from repo)
                     │

                +  */5 cron → publish-dashboard-launcher.sh (sub-minute ticks)
```

The page (`dashboard/index.html`, the source of truth, committed) loads its
siblings `data.js` and `stamp.js` with plain `<script src>` tags — which work
from a `file://` URL with no server. The Publisher rewrites both and copies
the page next to them each run. Opening the page needs nothing else.

## State it reads (verified 2026-07-14)

All paths derive from `config.json` (tilde-expanded `state_dir` and
`workspace_root`), read the same way `agent-cycle.sh` reads them.

- **`log.jsonl` — the FLEET's, not just ours** (requirements 33 and 2.5): this
  node's log unioned with every peer's fetched copy, via the same
  `lib/fleet.sh` read the pipelines use. Parsed line-by-line
  with `fromjson? // empty` so a half-written trailing line (the Script may be
  appending) never aborts the parse — and, separately, so a line a NUL run
  (an unclean stop, "Integration" below) has made unparseable is dropped
  rather than aborting the whole read. What that drop costs is not left
  invisible: the union lands raw on disk once and is parsed from there, so both
  line counts describe the one snapshot rather than two reads a pipeline's own
  appends can separate, and the difference rides the payload as
  `log_repair.dropped_log_lines`
  (agent-ops#794) — the log tail panel's own title names it whenever it is
  non-zero, "The Site" below. `revert-rate.jsonl`'s own read (below) is
  counted the identical way, into `log_repair.dropped_revert_rate_lines`,
  named the same way on the revert-rate panel's title. Blocked items use
  requirement 34's semantics (most recent `attempt-failed`/`unblocked` per
  `repo`+`item`) *less* the void set, which is requirement 34h's
  `open_blocked_items`; void items use
  requirement 34c's (most recent `item-void`/`unvoided`). Both come
  from the shared library, never from a local copy of the rule. With no peers
  the union reduces exactly to the old local read. Each blocked row is joined
  against the `escalated` and `enabler-examined` events *later than that block*
  (implementation spec 35, 36a), which is what gives the row its escalation link
  and the Enabler's last verdict; a mark older than the block belongs to an
  earlier one and is ignored.

  **Not every record in it came from a cycle.** A human may append one by hand
  — an `unvoided` to reopen an item, an `unblocked`, a `limit-hit` — and those
  carry the `cycle: "manual"` sentinel of implementation spec 33. The Publisher
  therefore admits to the cycle list only ids of the pipelines' own shape
  (`^[0-9]{8}T[0-9]{6}Z-`); every other id is a record about the pipeline
  rather than a run of it, and belongs in the log tail alone. The readers that
  act on those records — the limit stand-down, the blocked and void sets — key
  on the event and the item, never on the cycle, so none of them notices the
  distinction.
- **`<workspace_root>/.agent-ops-peers/<node>/`** — each fetched peer's state
  tree (implementation spec 2.5): its `heartbeat.json` becomes a `fleet.nodes[]`
  entry ({node, role, heartbeat, last cycle, version, compose, image, switch};
  older than `node_stale_after_minutes` (30 by default — three missed
  heartbeat/fetch cycles, not clock jitter) → `stale: true`, through the one
  verdict `lib/fleet.sh`'s `fleet_publication_status` computes for a peer's row
  and a node's own row alike (agent-ops#602)); its `cycles/<id>/`
  and `reviews/<id>/` transcripts
  render peer cycles with exactly the fidelity of local ones, and its `.out`
  envelopes join the fleet-wide cost roll-ups (every node spends one Claude
  account, so per-node spend would be the misleading number). The merged cycle
  detail list is capped at `MAX_CYCLES` *fleet-wide*, newest first across all
  nodes — that cap is what holds `data.js` near its single-node size however
  many nodes report. An id that exists on disk always renders from the owning
  node's directory (the D-before-E source ranking in the Publisher); an id
  known only from events renders from its events alone.

  **A no-op tick holds none of those slots** (issue #271). The `*/15` cadence
  makes most firings no-ops — the stand-down short-circuit (`cycle-start` →
  `stand-down` → `cycle-end`) and the lock-held skip (`cycle-start` →
  `cycle-skipped` → `cycle-end`) — and at a slot each they shrank the window
  from half a day of history to a couple of hours of mostly nothing. The
  Publisher classifies them ahead of the cap, by exactly those event shapes,
  and surfaces them as the single O(1) `noop_ticks` aggregate — total, split
  by the outcome value the ladder would have given the row (`stand-down` /
  `skipped`), and the newest timestamp — never as rows or a second list,
  because the cap is what protects `data.js`'s size and the aggregate must
  not grow with what it counts. A cycle that logged anything beyond those
  shapes keeps its row: a raced stand-down (`claim-lost`, 17d's badge), a
  pre-claimed one (`claim-skipped` — a selection defect, implementation spec
  17a), a hand-appended `unvoided` sharing its id, or a kill that cost it its
  `cycle-end` all carry information a count would bury.

  `noop_ticks.overlap` (implementation spec 11a, agent-ops#1287) rides in the
  same aggregate but is not a no-op count at all: it is a flat count of this
  window's own `cycle-skipped {reason: "overlap"}` events — schedule slots
  supercronic silently dropped because the cycle logging them was still
  running — and that cycle keeps its own row in `cycles[]` regardless, since
  it ran real stages of its own. `overlap` is never added into `total`,
  which still counts only ticks held out of the list; it travels alongside
  because a human scanning the fleet needs both numbers from the one place.

  Its **`log.jsonl` is also what says whether that peer is working, and on
  what** — `fleet.nodes[].live`. A peer publishes no lock (state-sync excludes
  it: a copied lock is a lock no process holds), so the answer is derived from
  the peer's own most recent cycle in the union stream, which requirement 33's
  `node` stamp makes separable: running until that cycle logs `cycle-end`, the
  live stage being the last `stage-start` with no matching `stage-end`, and the
  work whatever its `selection` event named. That derivation cannot see a node
  killed mid-cycle — a `cycle-start` with no end looks the same as one still in
  flight — so the page bounds the claim rather than the Publisher overstating
  it: a stale heartbeat renders as "state unknown", and a cycle running past
  `lock_stale_after` (the pipeline's own bound, past which it would take such a
  lock over — a derived figure since requirement 4f, which the Publisher
  computes and passes under that name) is flagged as possibly dead. A second,
  far earlier bound catches the case that actually happens. Every stage is
  capped by its own backstop, which `run_claude_stage` enforces by killing the
  process group and logging
  `stage-end` after — so a live stage older than its cap is not a slow stage but
  one whose process is already gone, and the page says so in minutes where
  `lock_stale_after` takes hours. A Co-Ordinator capped at twenty minutes
  against that rule's several hours is the whole of the gap: a node rolled
  mid-cycle read as
  "coordinator choosing work" for most of the way to its next cycle. A *peer's*
  bounds are measured to that peer's own heartbeat rather than to the reader's
  clock — what is known is what that node had published, and both timestamps are
  stamped by its clock, so the difference carries no skew between machines. Our
  own row is measured to `generated_at`, which is that same clock: self's
  `heartbeat_ts` is what the shared state last held for this node
  (`fleet_publication_status`, agent-ops#602), so it lags this render by a push
  interval plus a fetch interval even when publication is healthy, and by the
  whole outage when it is not — bounding our own live stage by it would delay
  the overrun badge, and suppress it outright on exactly the row an operator
  reads during a publication failure.
  `live.stage_since` is what makes this answerable, and `live.stage_backstop_min`
  — the cap that stage was actually given, announced on its own `stage-start`
  and carried through unchanged — is what it is held against. Every stage now
  has its own, so a shared configuration key could only ever approximate it;
  `config.stage_backstops`, the fleet-wide widest per actor, is the fallback for
  a row whose event predates the announcement, and a shipped prior the fallback
  after that. A stage none of those names (the review pipeline's) is one the
  rule makes no claim about.
- **`revert-rate.jsonl`** (D18 issue #579) — the fleet's own union, on the
  identical terms as `log.jsonl`/`review-log.jsonl`: this node's own file
  unioned with every fetched peer's, never rotated, reduced to the newest row
  per repository (by `ts`) rather than every row ever appended. See "Revert
  rate by repository" below.
- **`fleet-cache/{disabled,limit}.json`** — the fleet flags' cached copies
  (requirement 2.3a), maintained by `lib/toggle.sh` and refreshed by this
  Publisher's own GitHub tick. Read as plain files, so a `--no-github` tick and
  a standby node surface them with no API call. Surfaced as `fleet.flags` and
  rendered as banners: the fleet switch (suppressed when the local switch
  banner already covers it — the setting node writes both levels), and the
  fleet-wide usage-limit stand-down (shown when the local log union has not
  caught up — a standby with no state yet, or a hit seconds old elsewhere).
  Both banners name the flag's `actor` (falling back to the older `by` /
  `node` fields on records that predate it) and its `kind` (requirement 2,
  #244) — whose decision the stand-down is, and whether it was a decision at
  all: a `manual` limit record renders in the operator's voice ("set by …
  (manual)", never probed, `--clear-limit` lifts it early) rather than the
  detector's estimated-retry phrasing.
- **`fleet-cache/merge-autonomy-kill.json`** — the D18 merge-autonomy kill
  switch's own cached copy (D18 issue #576, `lib/merge-autonomy.sh`'s
  `MERGE_AUTONOMY_KILL_FLAG`). Narrower than the `disabled`/`limit` flags
  above and read differently from them for it: those two fail *open* on an
  unreadable record, so their raw cached bytes (`null` when clear) are the
  whole story; the kill switch fails *closed* (an unreachable state repo with
  no cache reads as engaged, `lib/merge-autonomy.sh`'s own header), a
  distinction only `merge_autonomy_kill_state` draws. This Publisher never
  calls that function outside its own GitHub tick — it always attempts a live
  fetch the first time a process asks it, which a `--no-github` tick or a
  standby node must not pay for — so the `--no-github`/local-only value runs
  the raw cache through `_toggle_eval` instead (the pure half of the same
  machinery, no network), defaulting to `{"state":"enabled"}` when no cache
  exists at all: a display default for "nothing confirms a kill", never the
  live gate's own fail-closed reasoning, which only applies once a fetch has
  actually found the repo unreachable. The live GitHub tick calls
  `merge_autonomy_kill_state` for real and overwrites this value with its
  accurate answer, fail-closed synthesis included — which also carries
  `merge_autonomy_kill_state`'s own `retried` boolean (always `false` here:
  this Publisher passes no `RETRY`, agent-ops#1081), where the local-only
  `_toggle_eval` value does not. Surfaced as
  `fleet.flags.merge_autonomy_kill` — `{state, retried?, record?}`,
  `lib/toggle.sh`'s own vocabulary — and rendered as its own banner,
  deliberately not folded
  into the fleet-switch banner above: cycles keep running while the kill
  switch is engaged, only landing collapses to `human` fleet-wide, so "every
  node stands down" would misreport it. A `record.kind` of `"fail-closed"`
  (the marker `merge_autonomy_kill_state` writes and nothing else does) omits
  the `--restore-merge-autonomy` advice a genuine `manual` kill's banner
  carries, since no command fixes a state-repo outage. `scripts/doctor.sh`
  reads the same function directly (its own "the merge-autonomy kill switch
  is …" line) — this is the same position, on the dashboard instead of a
  one-shot pass.
- **`disabled.json`** — the switch (requirement 2.3), read through
  `lib/toggle.sh`: the same code the pipelines gate on, so the dashboard cannot
  disagree with them about whether cycles are meant to be running (requirement
  34a). Surfaced as `status.switch` and rendered as the *first* banner, ahead
  of the usage-limit one.

  This panel earns its place by being the one thing a disabled pipeline looks
  like. Everything else on the page renders a disabled pipeline exactly as it
  renders a quiet one: no cycles, no PRs, no failures, no errors. Without the
  banner, a switch someone set on Tuesday is indistinguishable from a week with
  nothing to do — which is how it goes unnoticed until Friday. Show the reason,
  who set it (`actor`, falling back to `by`), its kind, and its expiry (or that
  it has none and needs `--enable`), since those are precisely the questions an
  operator has next.

  The same read (`toggle_switch_summary`, `lib/toggle.sh`) also feeds the
  node card's own **disabled** badge (implementation spec 2.3, `--this-node`
  — the graceful, single-node form): a node stood down that way sets no flag
  file anything else on this page reads, so without a badge on its own card it
  looks exactly like an idle one. This node's copy is read live, the same as
  its role and lock; a peer's arrives in its heartbeat as `switch`, on the
  same absent-means-unknown rule every other peer-only field on the card
  follows — a peer whose heartbeat predates the field, like one whose image
  or compose verdict does, renders no badge rather than a false "enabled".

  **A record's `scope` decides which of those two things it is** (implementation
  spec 2.3). A fleet-wide `--disable` also writes a local record on the node
  that issued it, tagged `scope: "fleet"` — a *mirror* of the fleet switch, not
  a stand-down of that node's own. While `fleet.flags.disabled` is set the page
  suppresses both the local banner and that node's badge in favour of the fleet
  banner, because one decision must not render as two problems, and an amber
  **disabled** badge on exactly one node of a uniformly-down fleet reads as a
  fault peculiar to that node. When the fleet flag is *clear* and a mirror
  survives, the opposite applies and both render, saying so: that node alone is
  standing down under a fleet decision lifted elsewhere — `--enable` on a peer
  clears the flag but cannot reach this node's file — and nothing else on the
  page would account for it.

  **`mode` (implementation spec 2.3d/2.9) changes the label, never the
  scope/mirror logic above.** `toggle_switch_summary` carries `mode`
  (`"stop"`/`"drain"`) alongside `scope`, so the same badge and the same two
  banners (node-scoped, fleet-wide) this section already describes render for
  a drain exactly as for a stop — only the text differs: **disabled** becomes
  **draining (N left)** or **drained**, and the banner headline reads "is
  draining"/"has drained" rather than "is disabled". `N` and whether it is
  `drained` come from `switch.drain` (`{remaining, at_rest, checked_at}`),
  folded in by `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh`/`scripts/state-sync.sh` from the
  last cycle's own at-rest check (requirement 2.9's cache) only when its
  `disabled_at` still matches the live record's — omitted, and rendered as a
  bare "draining" with no count, when no cycle has checked yet since this
  drain began (a `--drain` just issued, or one just extended). A drain never
  suppresses the badge/banner the way an *enabled* pipeline does — it is
  exactly as visible as a full stop, since "no new work, but existing work
  still landing" is just as easy to mistake for a quiet week as an outright
  stop is.
- **`cycles/<cycle-id>/<stage>.out`** — the stage's `result` envelope: the
  final line of the event stream `claude --output-format stream-json` wrote,
  truncated into this file by `run_claude_stage` and identical to what
  `--output-format json` used to leave here (requirements 11 and 4d). The
  stream itself, `<stage>.stream.jsonl`, is local to the node that ran it and
  never replicates, so this Publisher never sees one on a peer and reads none
  on its own node either. Fields used: `result` (final message → parsed
  into the work order / status object via the same algorithm `agent-cycle.sh`
  uses — straight parse, else the last fenced ``` block regardless of its
  info string (a bare fence or one tagged anything other than `json` is not
  ambiguous — only the fence's presence is, issue #237), else the
  earliest brace-opening line whose suffix parses as one JSON value;
  `test/extract-json-result.test.sh` holds the ports to it), `total_cost_usd`,
  `duration_ms`, `num_turns`, `is_error`, `terminal_reason`/`stop_reason`,
  `modelUsage` (→ model id). `<stage>.out.stderr` is shown for debugging.
  `docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md` is the formal contract for these fields — types,
  units, and what change to them is additive versus breaking — reused
  unchanged by the per-stage record `lib/metering.sh` writes to `log.jsonl`
  (requirement 33a); this reader and that one derive the same figures
  independently from the same envelope and are expected to agree.

  The **actor** that spent it is the transcript's own filename, and needs no
  new field: `cycles/<id>/{coordinator,implementer,reviewer,enabler,refiner}.out`
  name themselves, and `reviews/<id>/reviewer-<repo>.out` is normalised to
  `project-reviewer` from the directory two levels up — it belongs to the
  repository-review pipeline, not to the cycle Reviewer. Any other stem
  passes through verbatim, on the same fail-open rule as the source labels
  below.
- **`reviews/<review-id>/reviewer-<repo>.out`** — the repository-review
  pipeline's envelopes, read by the cost scan on exactly the same terms as a
  cycle's. It is one Claude account paying for both pipelines, so a roll-up
  that skipped this directory was not a per-pipeline figure but a wrong total —
  and it skipped the single most expensive actor per run, which is also the one
  an operator is most likely to be weighing up.

  `total_cost_usd` is a **local estimate computed from token counts**, priced
  as though the tokens had been billed per-token through the API. Under the
  subscription auth this pipeline runs on, it is not an amount charged and not
  a draw against any plan limit — it measures work done, not money spent. The
  envelope carries no quota, rate-limit, or credits-remaining field of any
  kind; do not expect one to appear here. See the design decision on plan
  limits below before building anything that treats these dollars as budget.
  Missing/partial files degrade to a null stage — never a crash.
- **`lock.json`** — `{pid, started_at, host}`. A live pid means a cycle is
  running now — but `kill -0` only answers that question inside the PID
  namespace that minted the pid, and the dashboard shares the scheduler's
  state volume without ever sharing its PID namespace (they are separate
  containers, `deploy/docker/compose.yaml`). So the Publisher reads `host`
  (the container that wrote the lock) first: only when it matches this
  container's own `$HOSTNAME`, or is absent (a lock predating the `host`
  stamp), does it trust `kill -0`. Any other lock is unanswerable from here —
  a pid that happens to match a live process in the dashboard's own namespace
  proves nothing about the scheduler's, and the reverse — so it reads as not
  alive, exactly as if there were no lock at all; `fleet.nodes[].live` for
  this node then falls back to the same log-derived state a peer's row uses.
  This is the same namespace confusion #130 fixed in the watchtower
  pre-update hook and TD-PPagop-26072901 fixed in both cycle scripts'
  `acquire_lock`. The cycle id is `<started>-<node>-<pid>` (older records
  `<started>-<pid>`) and the lock carries that same pid — last in either
  shape —
  so the running cycle's own events are exactly those whose id ends in
  `-<pid>`. From them the Publisher derives `status.current` — what the live
  cycle is working on right now: the running stage (the last `stage-start` with
  no matching `stage-end`) and the item the Co-Ordinator selected
  (`repo`/`item`/`source`/`title`). It is `null` when idle, and its fields fill
  in as the cycle progresses — `repo`/`item`/`title` appear only once selection
  has happened, since the Co-Ordinator stage runs before it has chosen anything.

  This is also **our own** `fleet.nodes[].live`, rather than the log derivation
  the peers get: a live pid is not an inference, and the derivation is wrong in
  one real case anyway — a tick that starts, finds the lock held and ends is the
  newest `cycle-start` on this node while the cycle actually holding the lock is
  still running. With no live lock our row falls back to the peers' derivation
  and is marked not running; a `cycle-start` with no `cycle-end` behind a dead
  lock is a cycle that was killed, and the page says so rather than rounding it
  to "idle".
- **`cron.log`** — tail shown, for "cron fired but nothing happened".
  `scripts/rotate-logs.sh` (agent-ops `IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`
  requirement 2.6) renames it to `cron.log.1` once it grows past
  `log_retained_bytes`, so the tail is read from `cron.log.1` followed by
  `cron.log` — never the live file alone — and a rotation never empties the
  panel.
- **`build-info.json` (in the image) or git `HEAD`** — what code this node is
  running, read through `lib/version.sh` and reported as `fleet.nodes[].version`
  ({pr, commit, short, built_at, repo, source, dirty}). `.dockerignore` keeps
  `.git` out of the image — the image is a deployment of this repository, not a
  copy of a working tree — so CI stamps the answer in at build time
  (`.github/workflows/build-image.yml`, `deploy/docker/Dockerfile`), and this
  reader falls back to git for a checkout, and to `null` for neither. The
  **pull request** is the useful half: a SHA names the bytes, `#89` names the
  change, and the page renders it through the same record card as every other
  number. Our own is read directly; a peer's arrives in its heartbeat, because
  a peer publishes no container. See the design decision on version skew below.
- **GitHub, via `gh`** (best-effort; the machine is authenticated and the
  repos are public): open PRs carrying `pr_label` with `statusCheckRollup`,
  `mergeable`, `mergeStateStatus`, `reviewDecision`, author, labels,
  draft/ready, and merge-queue state (`queued`/`dequeued`, D17 — see the
  Publisher below); most-recent-per-workflow
  failing runs on the default branch; open issues, each with the `Priority`
  band the Co-Ordinator ranks it by (read from the REST issues listing's
  `issue_field_values`, since `gh issue list --json` cannot see issue fields,
  and defaulted to `Medium` exactly as the pipeline defaults it — see the
  implementation-pipeline spec, requirement 15e), capped at one REST page
  (`per_page=30`, agent-ops#1171) with the true count behind that cap read
  separately, best-effort, as `issues_total`; security and code-quality
  findings, via `scripts/gather-findings.sh`; the tech-debt ledger's open
  items — one label search per repo for open `pw::type:tech-debt` issues
  (issue #881), capped at 40 (`{id, title, status, url}`; `status` is always
  `"open"`, since the search only ever returns open issues) with the true
  count behind that cap read alongside, for free, as `tech_debt_total` — the
  Search API's own `.total_count`, returned in the same call as the page of
  results; and one record per pull request
  the page refers to (`github.pr_index`, keyed `<owner>/<repo>#<number>`) — the
  open ones from the query above, the rest by `gh pr view`, cached permanently
  once terminal (see the Publisher).

  All five sources above (issues, failing runs, the tech-debt listing,
  findings, `pr list`) are read per repo as one of two states, `answered` or
  `failed`, carried in `github.inputs[<slug>].state` for the first four — `pr
  list` keeps its own long-standing pass/fail signal folded straight into
  `github.ok`/`github.error` instead, since no per-repo PR count is ever
  rendered for a `failed` marker to replace. The reason for the other four is
  that they used to conflate "nothing to report" with "the call did not
  answer": `gh_json` (the Publisher's plain reader) discards stderr, so a call
  that timed out, rate-limited or 500'd printed nothing, and nothing is
  exactly what a legitimately empty result also prints. A repo's tech-debt
  ledger can be genuinely empty, so "no open debt" and "the listing call
  failed" had become indistinguishable on the page — observed directly
  during PR #163's own testing, where a repo's ledger read empty on one tick
  and thirteen items the next with nothing in the register having changed
  (TD-PPagop-26080201, against the register-backed listing this replaced).
  `gh_call` (the Publisher's stderr- and exit-status-preserving reader,
  alongside `gh_json`) and `gather-findings.sh`'s own exit code are what make
  the distinction: any non-2xx response is `failed`. `gather-findings.sh`
  draws the same line without a state of its own to carry it: a repo with
  neither alert type enabled (403 or 404, provided a 403's own message does
  not name a rate limit) still exits 0 and reads `answered`, exactly as a
  repo with both features on and nothing open does; only a real failure — a
  timeout, rate limit or outage — exits 1 and reads `failed`. A `failed`
  source renders a "couldn't read" marker in place of its count, never a bare
  zero (see the Site, below). `github.ok`/`github.error` reflect a `failed`
  state from *any* of the five sources, not only `pr list`'s (historically
  the only one that raised the "GitHub unavailable" banner). If `gh` fails,
  the GitHub panels mark themselves stale and the rest still renders. On a
  `--no-github` refresh the fetch is skipped entirely and the last successful
  result is carried forward (see the Publisher below), so only a fetch that
  was *attempted and failed* ever shows as unavailable.

  `github.error` is a classified, collapsed summary, not the raw failures
  concatenated: every failed call's own message (`<source> failed for
  <slug>: <gh's own diagnosis>`) is classified by its embedded cause — 401 or
  "Bad credentials" as auth, 403 or a rate-limit phrase (`LIMIT_PHRASE_REGEX`,
  shared with `lib/limit-detect.sh`) as rate-limit, a connection/timeout
  string as network, anything else as other — and same-cause failures
  collapse into one line naming the cause with a call and repo count (e.g.
  "GitHub authentication failed (HTTP 401) — GH_TOKEN is invalid or expired ·
  15 calls across 3 repos"); a tick that fails more than one way gets one
  line per cause. This is what keeps the banner readable through an outage
  that touches every source of every repo — during the 2026-08-22 token
  expiry it was fifteen semicolon-joined "Bad credentials" bodies with the
  one fact that mattered, the token being dead, stated nowhere in the text.
  The full uncollapsed list still reaches `dashboard.log` (the launcher
  already tees the Publisher's own stderr there), and `github.error` names
  the log rather than inlining every message.

**Usage-limit detection.** The pipeline's own detector and the Publisher share
one phrase pattern and reset-time parser (`lib/limit-detect.sh`), so a
weekly-limit message ("resets Jul 17, 4am …") or a monthly spend-cap message
now gets logged as `limit-hit` by the Script itself, not just spotted by the
dashboard. The Publisher still also scans recent transcripts for limit
phrasing directly, as a backstop for any cycle where a `limit-hit` never made
it into the log for some other reason (a crash before `log_event` ran, or a
cycle from before this detector existed) — so the dashboard can still show a
stand-down the log itself missed.

The banner is built from the same reduction the pipelines gate on
(`limit_union_record`), so a `limit-cleared` event retires the banner at the
moment it retires the stand-down; a dashboard still reporting a limit the
pipelines have lifted would be exactly the disagreement requirement 34a
exists to prevent. Its wording comes from `limit_describe`, which states
whether `resume_at` is a reset the provider gave or an interval this system
chose. An estimate presented as a deadline gets waited out instead of
questioned — which is how a lifted spend cap kept the fleet down for a
further 22 hours on 2026-07-26 — so an unstated reset is labelled as such and
names both ways out: the plan's rollover, which needs nobody, and raising the
cap then running `agent-cycle.sh --clear-limit`, which needs a human and only
if sooner is wanted. Flags written by a node on the previous release carry
`needs_human` instead of `reset_known`; the banner inverts it rather than
treating its absence as "reset known".

## The Publisher (`scripts/publish-dashboard.sh`)

Reads the state above, assembles one JSON object, embeds this tick's own
`fingerprint` in it (below), redacts the whole thing, and writes it as
`window.DASHBOARD_DATA = {…}` to `data.js` (atomically: temp file + `mv`),
then writes `window.DASHBOARD_STAMP = {generated_at, fingerprint}` the same
way to a `stamp.js` sibling, carrying that identical fingerprint value — the
no-op skip's own (below), so client and skip logic never disagree about what
"changed" means. Falls back to `$now_iso`, unique to this tick, whenever
`local_state_fingerprint` could not produce a whole hash, or whenever this
tick's own cycle render failed: either failure would otherwise read as
"unchanged" to every open tab forever. Both writes happen back to back, with
nothing state-changing between them, so the two files' own content can never
disagree about which publish they came from — but a *reader* fetching them as
two separate HTTP requests is not part of that atomicity, and can still
observe them from two different publishes (a publish landing between the
requests). That only matters for the plain `<script src>` pair `index.html`
loads on first open, not for the SPA refresh tick, which always re-fetches
`data.js` itself once its fingerprint has moved — see "the client" below for
how the first load avoids the same wedge by reading its starting fingerprint
back out of `data.js` rather than out of `stamp.js`. It is `set -uo pipefail`
(not `-e`) because most reads are best-effort, and ends `exit 0`. It sets its
own `PATH` for cron and is `shellcheck`-clean.
Several measures keep a *rebuild* proportional to the window rather than to
the whole history: the
transcript cost scan reads envelopes in batches (one `jq` per 25 files, the
cycle's day and instant both derived from `input_filename` — the cycle/review
id's own `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-…` prefix reformatted to a plain ISO 8601 `ts`,
`null` for a directory name that doesn't match it rather than a guessed one;
a torn mid-write envelope costs at most the rest of its batch for one tick),
the detail window (the `MAX_CYCLES`
cycles shown with transcripts) is assembled in a single `jq` program over
every stage file the window touches — handed in via `--rawfile`, so jq opens
each one itself rather than a fork per cycle re-reading and re-parsing it —
plus the fleet-wide event union slurped once, and every potentially large
intermediate reaches `jq` as a file, never argv (a single argument caps at
128 KB, which transcript-bearing JSON exceeds).

`data.js`'s size is dominated by capped transcripts, not by the small
per-item records like `blocked[]`: one cycle at both caps (`TRANSCRIPT_CAP`
of `result` and of `stderr`, on all three stages) measures 245,676 bytes on
its own — `(40000 + 40000) * 3` bytes of capped text plus ~5.7 KB of envelope
and structure — so the `MAX_CYCLES`-cycle window bounds near `40 *
245,676 ≈ 9.4 MB` in the pathological case of every shown cycle maxing out
both caps on every stage (measured directly, not derived from the constants
alone). Against that, `blocked[]`'s `kind` field (added for TD26072603) costs
9 bytes a row when empty (`"kind":""`) and 25 when it is `needs-refinement`
(`"kind":"needs-refinement"`) — measured by publishing a 20-row synthetic
`blocked[]` before and after the field was added (14,910 bytes total, +340
bytes for the field across the 20 rows, half of them `needs-refinement`) — so
even a blocked list two orders of magnitude longer than any fleet has run
stays a rounding error against the transcript budget above. No cap on
`blocked[]`'s length exists or is warranted by this change.
`--no-github` skips the live GitHub fetch for a faster, offline run. Rather
than blanking the GitHub panels, it reuses the last real fetch — cached at
`<state_dir>/.dashboard-github.json` and re-marked `stale` — so the PR list,
work sources and ok/error state all persist, and no false "GitHub unavailable"
banner fires. That is what lets the sub-minute heartbeat refresh local state
every few seconds while hitting the GitHub API only once per window.

`--now <iso8601>` overrides the single instant (`now_iso`/`now_epoch`) every
rolling window in this script measures from — the WI-8 landing digest's
`in_window`/`stale()` cutoffs, the merge-budget reading, the decisions digest,
the GitHub-budget card, and the cost roll-ups' `day_cut`/`today`/`recent_cut`
— the same test seam `scripts/publish-revert-rate.sh` and
`scripts/autonomy-stage-report.sh` already provide. Omitted, it defaults to
the real wall clock; it exists only so a test can pin every window this
script computes to a calendar date it controls, rather than the clock the
test happens to run under.

Those measures bound a rebuild; they do not make one cheap. A full publish
grew from 5.1 s when they were introduced (#51) to 18.1 s by 2026-08-25 —
roughly fifteen dashboard panels later, each legitimately adding a `jq` pass
over the same inputs — against a heartbeat that asks for one every five
seconds. The launcher had no way to tell "publishing every 5 s as designed"
from "publishing continuously and never idle": both look like a full window of
`wrote …` lines, and two idle nodes held two of six cores producing
byte-identical payloads.

So the Publisher has the no-op short-circuit the Co-Ordinator has
(`lib/noop-skip.sh`, requirement 3b), on the same claim: if nothing it reads
has moved since it last published, publishing again buys the same bytes at the
same price. A `--no-github` tick fingerprints every path under the state dir
and the peers dir — plus `config.json`, the page template and the script
itself — and exits without building anything when that fingerprint matches the
one stored beside the last publish. The skipped ticks are counted and reported
by the next real publish (`… after N no-op tick(s)`) rather than logged one by
one.

Two properties make that safe against the stale-page failure `lib/noop-skip.sh`
warns about, where a missed input stalls everything silently. It covers by
exclusion rather than enumeration — everything under the state dir counts
except what the Publisher and its heartbeat write themselves (the served
directory, `dashboard.log*`, and the `.dashboard-fingerprint`,
`.dashboard-skips`, `.dashboard-tick-cost`, `.dashboard-payload`,
`.dashboard-cycle-cache/` and `.dashboard-cyclerows-cache/` bookkeeping
beside it), what the
Publisher never reads (`state-sync.log`, `doctor.log`, `tech-debt-archive.log`, and the `*.err`
sidecars), and the caches a timer rewrites with identical content — so an
input a later panel adds is covered on the day it is added, and the failure
direction of a mistake is a needless rebuild, never a stale page. Those caches
(`fleet-cache/*.json`, `.image-drift-cache.json`, `.doctor-status.json`,
`.dashboard-*.json`) are excluded from the size-and-mtime scan and folded in by
**content hash** instead, so a verdict that actually changed still rebuilds
while one merely rewritten does not. Directory entries are not counted at all:
adding or replacing a file moves its directory's mtime, which would put back
exactly the self-reference these exclusions remove, and a file that appears,
changes or vanishes is already visible as a file. Anything this script writes
under the state dir has to join that list on the day it is added, or it
invalidates the very skip it sits beside. Getting this wrong is not
theoretical — the fingerprint counted its own outputs for a day and a half, so
no tick ever skipped and the feature it was built for saved nothing (#801,
#803). And a GitHub tick never skips, so even a fingerprint wrong in the
dangerous direction can only hold a stale page until the next one, about five
minutes (`LAUNCHER_GITHUB_MAX_AGE`) — the cadence the dashboard published at
before the sub-minute heartbeat existed (#26).

### The tiered publish

Skipping only helps a node with nothing happening on it. A node running a cycle
writes to `state_dir` continuously, so its fingerprint moves on every tick and
it rebuilds every time — which is the node where the cost actually lands. A full
publish measured 15.8s on `ockham-container`, and against the launcher's 1:9
duty cycle that put the page about two and a half minutes behind the pipeline it
exists to show.

So a tick has two kinds, and `--fast` chooses:

- A **full build** assembles the whole payload, and writes it to
  `<state_dir>/.dashboard-payload` afterwards. Every GitHub tick is a full
  build, which is what bounds how stale anything carried forward can be — no
  separate clock, and nothing that can drift out of step with the one cadence
  guaranteed to run.
- A **fast build** recomputes only what moves between ticks — `status`,
  `cycles`, `log_tail`, `cron_tail`, `fleet`, `revert_rate`, `log_repair` —
  and merges those keys over the last full payload. The history roll-ups
  (`counts` and its actor-scorecard and classifier-escape enrichments,
  `blocked`, `void`, `landings`, `github_budget`, `rework`, `constraint`,
  `fleet_sizing`, `spend_fate`, `turns_per_landed_item`, and
  the stage budgets inside `config`) are not computed at all: they read the
  fleet's whole history and change on the scale of cycles, not ticks.
  `constraint` is the one whose skipping is worth its own sentence: it is what
  needs a *second* fleet-wide log union (`review-log.jsonl` beside
  `log.jsonl`), so computing it on a fast tick would double that read on the
  per-tick path for a value the fast payload does not carry. `fleet_sizing`
  reads the node time-state account that union produces rather than fetching
  it again, so it is gated for the same reason at no further cost. The stage
  budgets read that same union a second time (issue #1586, so that
  `config.stage_backstops` can carry a `project-reviewer` entry) rather than
  fetching it again, so this stays a single extra read shared by two
  roll-ups, not two.

A fast build emits only the keys it recomputed and merges them **over** the
cached payload rather than assembling a whole object from variables the skipped
regions never set. That direction is the safety property: a key it forgets keeps
its previous value, where a key a full-style assemble forgot would render `null`
and blank a panel. Staleness is bounded and visible against `generated_at`; a
blanked panel is neither. A fast build with no usable payload cache is silently
a full build, and a merge that fails re-runs itself in full rather than leaving
the page to age.

The cycle window is cached per cycle under `<state_dir>/.dashboard-cycle-cache/`,
keyed on that cycle's stage files (size and mtime), how far its own events have
got (count and newest timestamp), and a digest of the program that renders it —
so an image roll invalidates every entry, which is the case a key made only of
inputs would miss. A cycle that renders to nothing caches that verdict too, or
it is recomputed on every tick for as long as it stays in the window. The cache
is pruned to the window on each publish: entries are never touched on a hit, so
an mtime sweep would evict exactly the cycles still in use.

The window itself — which `MAX_CYCLES` ids the cache above even gets asked to
render — is cached too, under `<state_dir>/.dashboard-cyclerows-cache/`
(#993). Without it, every tick re-globs the local and every peer's `cycles/`
directory (bounded by `state_local_cycles_retained`, 1000 on every node) to
produce a list bounded by the constant `MAX_CYCLES`, however few of those
1000 entries actually moved since the last tick. The key is a stat, not a
content hash: the local and each peer's `cycles/` directory mtime, at
nanosecond resolution (which moves exactly when an entry is added or removed
— the same signal a cache entry's own key uses for a stage file, never
reused here as a *liveness* signal, which is the distinct use #803's cache
key confused; nanosecond rather than whole-second resolution because the
union log below is already protected against a same-second change by its
own size field, but a `cycles/` directory has only its mtime to catch one),
plus the union event log's own size and mtime (covers the ids known only
from the event stream). The key is stat'd before the union log is read and
built, not after: reading it first would let a log append or directory
change that lands in the gap between the read and the stat get baked into a
key that still matched the stale cache, serving rows missing whatever just
landed until some later, unrelated tick moved the key. A tick whose key is
unchanged copies the cached row list straight into place, falling through to
a rebuild if the copy itself fails rather than publishing an empty window; a
tick whose key moved rebuilds the row list and refreshes the cache.

That render **excludes events belonging to no cycle before it groups the union
by `.cycle`**, and reports its own success or failure as `cycle_render`. Both
halves are load-bearing. The union carries records no cycle produced —
`scripts/publish-revert-rate.sh` stamps its post-merge-revert `rework` rows
`cycle: null` deliberately, since they are mined outside any cycle and an
invented id would be a worse answer than an honest null, and `log-repaired`
does likewise — and grouping those into a bucket keyed `null` is a hard `jq`
error, not a null row: it kills the program that renders *every* cycle in the
window at once. The cache then drains as the window slides over cycles that
were never rendered, so a fault of any duration ends in the same place, an
empty `cycles[]`. Because that is also what an idle fleet produces, the failure
has to be stated rather than inferred: `jq`'s first error line goes to the
Publisher's log **and** into `cycle_render.error`, and the publish otherwise
completes, since one broken panel must not cost the other twenty. A tick that
rebuilt nothing — every cycle already cached — is `ok`, which is the common
case and not a failure.

A failed render also **withholds the state fingerprint** the next tick's
no-op skip reads. That stamp asserts "this page is what that state renders
to", which a died render makes false; leaving it would let the skip hold the
broken window in place until some unrelated part of the state moved, which on
a quiet node is unbounded. Dropping it costs one rebuild and puts the retry on
the next tick, so a transient fault heals itself with nothing else changing.
The cache sweep is *not* conditioned on the render: it prunes to the window,
which is correct whatever the render did.

Measured on `ockham-container` (35,574 union events, 1000 local cycles, three
peers): a full build 15.8s → 11.1s, and a fast build 4.4s — which at 1:9 puts a
cycle's progress on the page inside about 45 seconds, against two and a half
minutes before. The `cycles` payload is byte-identical to the unbatched build's.

Redaction is unconditional: `/home/<user>` and `/Users/<user>` → `~`, and
`ghp_/gho_/github_pat_/sk-…/Bearer …` token shapes → `[REDACTED-TOKEN]`,
applied to the whole serialised payload before writing. The pattern set
itself is `lib/redact.sh`, shared with `scripts/state-sync.sh`, which
applies the identical pass to what it pushes to the private state-mirror
repository (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 2.5,
agent-ops#966) — one place to add a pattern for a new secret shape, rather
than two. A bearer secret carried in a webhook URL's own path (the
configured `notify_webhook_url`/`escalation_webhook_url`) has no such shape,
so the Publisher registers that resolved value for masking
(`redact_add_literal`, `lib/redact.sh`, agent-ops#1721) right after it
resolves it, before this pass runs — the same registration
`scripts/state-sync.sh` makes for its own push. A value containing a
newline registers as a no-op instead (a single `sed` rule cannot span one),
so the Publisher checks the same condition itself immediately before the
call and warns on stderr when it holds (agent-ops#1730) — the run still
succeeds and the existing token-shape redaction is unaffected, but the value
itself reaches the payload unmasked, and this is the one operator-visible
signal that happened.

The `DASHBOARD_DATA` shape (the contract the page renders):

`github.pr_index` is the record behind every `#number` the page renders — the
open-PR table, the cycle that raised one, the version a node is running. Its
references are gathered from the page itself (each shown cycle's `pr_url`, each
node's reported version), so it holds exactly what is on screen and cannot grow
past it. Entries for open pull requests come free with the label query above;
the rest cost one `gh pr view` each, and a **merged or closed pull request is
never re-read** — its record cannot change, so `<state_dir>/.dashboard-prs.json`
caches it permanently and a warm index costs nothing per tick. Only entries
still open are refreshed, and only hourly. A cold index is filled at most eight
references per tick: forty `gh pr view` calls at up to `GH_TIMEOUT` each would
not fit in the heartbeat's window, and nothing waits on it — an unindexed
number renders as the plain link it has always been.

**Merge-queue awareness** (D17, agent-ops#374/#375): each open pull request in
`github.prs[]` carries `queued` (`true`/`false`/`null` — `null` only when the
probe below has never once answered for it) and `dequeued` (`true` while it is
a state a human should look at). `queued` is `lib/merge-queue.sh`'s
`merge_queue_probe` read directly — the same probe
`scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh` (requirement 38f) already uses, shared
rather than reimplemented — for every open, **non-draft** pull request the
label query returns; GitHub will not enqueue a draft, so one is never worth
the call, and this needs no miss budget of its own the way `pr_index` and the
tech-debt roster do, because the set probed is exactly this tick's open agent
pull requests, already bounded by `max_open_agent_prs`. `dequeued` is *not*
the probe's own `dequeued_at`/`dequeue_reason` (the last removal event on the
pull request's timeline, regardless of age or of a later re-queue —
agent-ops#394's still-open finding against that reading): it is a small state
machine the Publisher keeps itself, `{queued, warn}` per pull request in
`<state_dir>/.dashboard-queue.json`, rewritten wholesale each GitHub tick from
that tick's own open pull requests (so a merged or closed one simply has no
entry next tick, rather than being pruned by rule). `warn` sets the tick
`queued` is observed to flip from `true` to `false`, stays set on every later
tick that still reads not-queued — a maintainer glancing at the page between
heartbeats must still see it — and clears the moment either `queued` reads
`true` again or the pull request drops out of the open list. A probe that
cannot answer (`merge_queue_probe` failing, same as any other best-effort
GitHub read) carries the last known answer forward unchanged, both the badge
shown this tick and what is written back to the cache, rather than ever
guessing `false` — the one direction that could silently clear a live warning
or falsely raise one — and does not itself trip `github.ok`, the same
treatment `sweep-human-visibility.sh` gives the identical probe. A repository
with no merge queue enabled needs no detection of its own: `isInMergeQueue` is
always `false` and no `RemovedFromMergeQueueEvent` ever fires there, so
`queued`/`dequeued` are always `false` and the open-PR table renders exactly
as it did before this feature existed. The open-PR table (below) shows
`queued` as a **queued** badge distinct from ready/draft/conflicting — "landing
hands-off" — and `dequeued` as an amber warning badge beside the pull
request's ordinary state badge; the same `dequeued` also raises a page-wide
amber banner (`⚠ N open agent PR(s) removed from the merge queue without
merging.`) beside the failing-checks one, so it is visible without opening the
table.

`github.inputs[<slug>].tech_debt` is that repo's open tech-debt issues as
work: one row per open `pw::type:tech-debt`-labelled issue, carrying the
issue's own `title`, a link to it, and `status: "open"` (issue #881; every row
this label search can return is open by construction, so no other status
ever appears). The search that fills it hands back the true count behind its
own 40-row cap in the same call — `.total_count` — so nothing further is
read to know whether the cap has clipped anything, and nothing is cached
between ticks: unlike the frozen register this replaced, a label search
answers every row in one call, so there is no per-tick miss budget to spend
and no per-item metadata to keep warm.

`fleet.claims` is the live claim registry (implementation spec 17a), read on
the GitHub tick and carried between ticks by the same cache as `github` (it
rides in `github.claims`; `fleet.claims` is the surfaced view). One recursive
`git/trees` call enumerates the registry — path and blob SHA per claim — and
each body is then read by SHA from `git/blobs` unless
`<state_dir>/.dashboard-claims.json` already holds it. Since a blob's SHA is a
hash of its bytes, a cache hit cannot be stale, so a fleet whose claims are
not moving costs one API call a tick however many claims it holds. (It was a
`contents/` walk: one call for the claims directory, one per repository under
it and one per claim.) Every node renders the same fleet, so any node's URL
answers "what is the operation doing" — `node` (header: "· <name>") is what
tells two otherwise identical tabs apart.

### Fleet-level invariants (the pager)

`lib/pager.sh`'s registry of fleet-level invariants (implementation spec
requirement 51) is evaluated from inside this script's own `WITH_GITHUB`
block — gated on `WITH_GITHUB` specifically, not merely `FULL`: firing or
clearing an invariant may create or close a GitHub issue, which a
`--no-github` tick (the test suite, or a local-only refresh) must never do.
By the time that block runs, this node's own union log
(`events_jsonl`) and every peer's heartbeat (`fleet_nodes_json`) have
already been assembled earlier in this same run, so `pager_evaluate` reads
both without a second fetch of either. `pager_enabled` (default `true`)
gates the whole call; `false` skips it outright, the same as `--no-github`
does structurally.

One invariant needs a third artefact, which this block therefore assembles
itself: `review-pipeline-failing` (agent-ops#1282) reads the review
pipeline's own log, not the implementation one, so the block runs
`fleet_logs` a second time over `review-log.jsonl` — fleet-replicated like
`log.jsonl`, and excluded from neither — and hands the result to
`pager_evaluate` as `REVIEW_UNION_LOG_FILE`. It is assembled here rather
than alongside `events_jsonl` above because it has exactly one reader, on a
path already gated to `WITH_GITHUB`: an ordinary tick never pays for it.
The block also reads the two config keys agent-ops#1282 added —
`pager_stale_file_after_minutes`, passed to
`pager_register_builtin_invariants` as `node-stale`'s own per-key filing
hysteresis, and `pager_dashboard_fetch_seconds` — along with the raw
(unconverted-to-seconds) `node_stale_after_minutes` and
`updater_stuck_after_minutes` those invariants compare against directly.

Because `pager_evaluate` may itself append `pager-*` transition events to
this node's own `log.jsonl`, the payload's own `pager` array is read from a
*fresh* re-union of the fleet log — `fleet_logs` run again, after
`pager_evaluate` returns — rather than the `events_jsonl` snapshot taken
before it: that snapshot cannot see what this tick itself just wrote. This
is the one place in the script that reads the union log twice in a single
run, and deliberately so.

The `pager` key of the payload (present on a `FULL` build, carried forward
by a fast one on the same terms every other `FULL`-only key already is) is
an array of the invariants currently in the `fired` state:
`{key, first_seen, evidence, nodes, issue_number, issue_url}` — `nodes`,
when the invariant supplied one, is which fleet nodes the evidence names,
for the node-card badge below; `issue_number`/`issue_url` are `null` for a
filing that failed and fell back to `escalation_webhook_notify`'s own
webhook-only path, so a page can still be firing on the dashboard with
nothing to click through to.

## The Site (`dashboard/index.html`)

One self-contained file: inline CSS + vanilla JS, no framework, no build step,
no external network requests (works fully offline). Renders from
`window.DASHBOARD_DATA`; every panel handles missing data gracefully.
Theme-aware (light/dark via `prefers-color-scheme`); wide tables scroll
inside their own container. Refreshes in place rather than reloading: on a
configurable interval (`config.json`'s `dashboard_refresh_seconds`, default
5s) it injects a cache-busted `<script>` — not `fetch()`, so it keeps working
from a `file://` URL with no server or CORS — fetching `stamp.js` (a few dozen
bytes: `{generated_at, fingerprint}`) first, and `data.js` itself only when
`stamp.js`'s `fingerprint` no longer matches the one the page last loaded
(issue #1288: every open tab was re-downloading the multi-megabyte `data.js`
on every tick, unconditionally, regardless of whether the underlying data had
moved). A refresh tick's own `data.js` fetch failing (a lost connection: the
injected `<script>`'s `onerror` fires) leaves the page's last-loaded
fingerprint unmoved, so the very next tick sees its stamp still disagree and
retries — advancing it regardless, on a fetch that never actually landed,
would wedge the tab on stale data indefinitely, since every later tick would
then find its own fresher stamp "agree" with a fingerprint the tab never
actually applied. It re-renders the body **only when the data actually
changed** (a signature compare that ignores the always-moving `generated_at`);
the header's own staleness clock still ticks every refresh, from `stamp.js`'s
own `generated_at`, whether or not `data.js` was worth re-fetching. Expanded
cycle rows, opened void rows and a void list showing past its cap, open
transcript panels and scroll position survive the re-render — both the page's
own scroll position and, independently, the position scrolled to within any
transcript box (a stage's status/result/stderr, or the cron.log tail): each
such box carries a stable key across rebuilds so a reader mid-scroll through a
long transcript is not dropped back to its top by the next refresh; the
header's staleness clock ticks every interval and warns if the heartbeat looks
stopped.

The page's very first load — a plain `<script src>` pair in `<head>`, not the
refresh tick's cache-busted injection — fetches `data.js` and `stamp.js` as
two separate, uncoordinated HTTP requests, so a publish landing between them
can pair a *newer* stamp with the `data.js` the tab actually has (the
Publisher's own back-to-back writes only make the two files agree with each
other, not with what a reader fetches when — see the Publisher section
above). `index.html` sidesteps this rather than relying on that window being
narrow: `data.js` carries the Publisher's fingerprint embedded in its own
JSON, and the page's starting comparison value is read from there, not from
`stamp.js`, so it is always exactly the fingerprint of the data the tab
actually parsed on load, however stale that publish might already be by the
time `stamp.js` answers. Only the initial load needs this — every later tick
already re-fetches `data.js` itself the moment its fingerprint moves, so it
can never fall behind its own stamp.

The header carries **two** clocks, because the page has two ages: `data <age>`
from `generated_at`, which moves every few seconds, and `· GitHub <age>` from
`github.fetched_at`, which moves once per heartbeat window. Everything sourced
from GitHub — PRs, checks, issues, work sources, claims — is as old as the
second clock however recent the first is, and the design that makes that so
(a `--no-github` tick carrying the last fetch forward rather than blanking the
panels) is exactly what would otherwise hide a stalled fetch: half-hour-old PR
data renders identically to fresh. Past 12 minutes the GitHub clock turns
amber and a banner names the fetch time. That banner is distinct from the
`ok === false` one: this is a fetch that stopped happening, that one is a
fetch that ran and failed.

Panels: status header ("· <node>" naming the page's own node, then the live
state — on a single-node page that node's own running/idle plus the stage,
repo, work source and item it is working on; on a fleet page a **summary**:
how many of how many nodes are running, who and in which repo while that is
still a glance (three or fewer), and badges counting any nodes that look dead
or whose state has gone stale) + a static **documentation nav** (`Docs:`
followed by six links — README, the three pipeline specs, the metering
schema, the roadmap — each opening the file at `blob/main/<path>` on GitHub
in a new tab; no data behind it, so it renders identically on every load) +
disabled / fleet-switch / merge-autonomy-kill-switch / usage-limit
/ fleet-limit / failing-checks / dequeued-pr / gh-down / node-stale /
doctor-fail / doctor-warn / stage-health-failing banners
(the switch first: when it is set, every other quiet signal on the page
is a consequence of it rather than news, and an operator reading them in the
other order goes looking for a fault that isn't there);
**the fleet strip** — one card per node carrying that node's own live state
(name, role — with a **disabled** badge beside it when that node carries its
own node-scoped disable (#379), naming the reason and expiry — running/idle,
the stage, repo, work source and item in flight and
since when — or, when idle, when its last cycle ended and how it went — the
**version it is running** as `image #<pr> <short-sha> · built <age>` with the
pull request carrying its record card, a grey `behind` marker when the fleet
holds a newer build and an amber `modified` one on a checkout with uncommitted
work, and how
fresh that answer is: read live for our own row, "as of its last push" for a
peer — or "no publication seen yet" for a peer nothing has ever been read back
for, `fleet_publication_status`'s `unknown` being a different claim from an
aged publication and never worded as one); a red **N stage(s) failing** badge (agent-ops#662) beside the
running/idle state, independent of it — the whole point being a node whose
process is alive and whose cycles are completing, which reads as plain
"running" or "idle", while one or more stages have failed every attempt for
`threshold` cycles running (see the Stage health section below for which,
and since when); any stale node — self included (agent-ops#602) — bordered
red; a stale *peer* additionally reports its running/idle state as "state
unknown", since only a peer's own liveness claim depends on a heartbeat that
can go stale — self's is read straight from its own lock and log regardless
of its publication verdict; one amber **peer view stale** badge across the
whole strip, not per card, when `fleet.peers.stale` is set (implementation
spec 2.5/#990) — a frozen or dead fetch cron makes every peer card go stale
at once, and this badge is what says the cause is "this node cannot see the
fleet" rather than "the fleet is down"; reads *"peer view stale — last
successful fetch `<last_ok_ts>`, failing since `<ts>`"* for `ok: false`, or
*"peer view stale — fetch not running since `<ts>`"* for a stale `ok: true`;
self is definitionally fresh and unaffected, and nothing renders once the
marker is fresh or for a node that has never fetched; click a card to
filter the cycle list and the recent log to that node, click again to clear —
the filter survives refreshes like every other UI state; **live claims** — the
registry rows, i.e. work no other node will pick up. Both, plus the cycles
table's Node column,
appear only once the fleet has more than one node (or a claim exists): a
single-node page renders exactly as it always did.

The live-claims panel's own **Held** column reads a row's `ts` through the same
relative-time renderer as the rest of the page, with one exception: a claim
whose `ts` is the fixed sentinel `lib/claim.sh`'s `do_expire()` backdates a
discarded Enabler/Refiner tombstone to (`1970-01-01T00:00:01Z`, implementation
spec 35c) never renders that literal ~56-year age. The panel recognises the
sentinel and reads the row "expired — pending cleanup" instead (agent-ops#839)
— the claim is correctly marked for `gc`'s next TTL sweep, and the column says
so rather than a number that was never a real age.

The strip is rebuilt on every refresh tick alongside the header, not only when
the body re-renders, because its cards carry running clocks ("since 18m ago")
and the body deliberately sits still while the data is unchanged.
Then metric cards (spend today/total — fleet-wide, one shared account —
failures, reached-ready, back-pressure gauge vs `max_open_agent_prs`. The
gauge's own figure is the same four-part sum `agent-cycle.sh` trips its cap
on (requirement 2.2) — draft PRs, ready PRs still `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, and
live claims — rather
than a figure the page derives from the open-PR listing alone: a live claim
is work already in flight whose PR does not exist yet, so it cannot appear
there. For a repository configured at `agent-merges-routine` or above, the
card additionally narrows the human-queue exclusion to an **otherwise-
eligible** ready pull request (D18 WI-6, issue #946), mirroring requirement
2.2's own level-aware paragraph: a ready, non-`CHANGES_REQUESTED` pull
request whose `complexity:*` label is outside that repository's
`merge_autonomy_routine_complexity` list stays in the human queue, since
nothing downstream of the Approver will ever land it automatically. A
`CHANGES_REQUESTED` pull request is exempt from the narrowing at every
level, exactly as it is in requirement 2.2 — the pipeline still owes it a
change — so the card can never hold fewer pull requests against the cap
than the plain rule would. This reads the repository's
*configured* `merge_autonomy` level (`D.config`) combined with the
fleet-wide kill switch the page already fetches for the banner above — never
the live effective level, which also needs a per-repository merge-budget-
freeze read the Publisher does not make on every tick — and complexity
alone, never a pull request's originating source, which carries no field on
GitHub and is not data this page holds. Which registry rows those are is `claim.sh count`'s rule, transcribed
rather than re-derived — a card reporting a different figure from the gate it
depicts is worse than no card — and it excludes two kinds of row. Rows under a
**pseudo-slug** (`enabler`, `refiner`) are the Enabler's and Refiner's
engagement tombstones: never released, retired only by `claim.sh gc`, and
never seen by the cycle, which asks `claim.sh count` for one configured repo
at a time. The page reads the whole registry in one tree call, so it must
re-impose that scope itself or the gauge climbs with every item the Enabler
examines and pins red against an open gate. Rows **naming a pull request
already in the sum** are that PR a second time: the `pr-<n>` exclusion entry
always, and a `pr-<n>-<kind>-<scope>` item ref when its PR is among the drafts
or changes-requested PRs counted above — but not when that PR sits in the
human's queue (conflicted, dequeued), where the claim is the only record the
work is in flight. The card's `title` tooltip spells out the same split the cycle logs,
e.g. "1 changes-requested + 0 draft + 1 unraised claim(s) — plus 13 waiting
on human (14 raw)", with a line underneath naming the raw open-PR total and,
when it differs, how many of those are sitting only in a human's queue
(approved, or awaiting a review nothing is
`CHANGES_REQUESTED`-blocking): a full human queue reads as "waiting on
human", not as the pipeline sitting idle). The spend-today card's own word
"today" is a button:
clicking it cycles the card's label and figure through **today (GMT)** (the
Publisher's own `spend_today_usd`), **today (local)** and **last 24h** (both
computed here, from `counts.recent_costs`, against the reader's own clock and
zone — the one thing about "today" the Publisher itself cannot know). The
choice is written to `localStorage` (`dashboard.spendMode`) as it is made and
read back on every load, so it survives a real reload and not just the
in-place refresh the rest of this section describes — the first state on this
page to do so — and an unset or unrecognised stored value reads as the GMT
default rather than an error; open PRs (a **queued** badge in place of ready for
one currently in a merge queue, and an amber **dequeued** badge beside a pull
request's state badge for one a queue removed without merging — see
"Merge-queue awareness" above); recent cycles (outcome and work source at
a glance — a cycle that has not logged `cycle-end` shows the state it is in
rather than an outcome it has not reached: **in progress** while a node claims
it as its live cycle (greyed when that node's own report has gone stale,
amber and questioned once it is running past `lock_stale_after`), **no clean
end** when no node is running it, and **not ended** when the data carries no
node state to ask; click a row for per-stage detail with
the parsed status, full transcript, and stderr; beneath the table, one muted
summary line for `noop_ticks` — the count held out of the list, split stood
down / lock-held skips, with how fresh the newest is — shown only when there
are any, plus a second muted line naming any overrun-slot firings
(`noop_ticks.overlap`, implementation spec 11a) — shown whenever there are
any, independently of the first line, since these were never held out of the
list the way a no-op tick's own are — and both only while the list is
unfiltered, since the aggregate is fleet-wide and must not sit under a
single node's rows; a window that is
*all* no-ops reads "No substantive cycles in the fleet window." over that
line, keeping "No cycles recorded yet." for a page with genuinely nothing —
except that a `cycle_render.ok` of `false` outranks both of those and every
node-filtered variant, since the list is then empty for a reason that is not
the fleet's: a red banner names the Publisher's own failure and quotes its
error, because an empty list that is silently attributed to an idle fleet is
how the 2026-08-29 blackout went ten days unnoticed);
failures,
blocked and void items (the void list newest first — it arrives grouped by
repo and item, which no reader wants — and **capped twice**: the ten newest
rows, each three lines tall, with the rest behind a `See more — N older items`
control at the foot of the table and any row opening to its full text when
clicked, both choices surviving a refresh. The heading counts every void item,
not the rows shown); work sources per repo (including the security and
code-quality findings, shown first, that the Co-Ordinator prioritises, and the
open issues, listed in `Priority` band order with the band on each, which is
the order the Co-Ordinator reaches them in) — the issues and tech-debt counts
read as plain numbers unless their own source cap actually clipped something,
in which case they read "shown of total" instead (`issues_total`/
`tech_debt_total`; see the Publisher and "Design decisions" below);
each repo whose `config.json` entry carries a non-zero `nice` (pipeline spec,
requirement 3) also carries a **badge** naming that value, blue below zero and
grey above, with the weighting it buys — `2^(-nice/3)`, the multiple by which
the Script inflates that repo's staleness age when it orders the repo walk —
and the disclaimer that it biases the walk without starving anything. A note
above the panel says the **Script** is what acts on a `nice`, because the panel
is headed with what the *Co-Ordinator* sees and a `nice` is the one ordering
input it is never given; without that line the badge would assert, on the
page's only per-repo surface, exactly the thing requirement 3 is careful not to
do. A repo at `0` or with no key carries neither badge nor note, so a fleet
that has set no `nice` anywhere renders the panel it rendered before the
feature existed. The values reach the page unaided — `config.repos` already
ships wholesale — so this is rendering only: the Publisher is unchanged;
**Actor and model scorecards** (immediately below the work sources, and
deliberately: that panel is what the Co-Ordinator was handed, this one is how
each actor's model choice did with what it was handed — issue #610, D22);
the cost charts — by-day, by-model, by-actor, then the two cost notes —
flowed through a CSS multi-column layout in that reading order, letting the
browser balance the split by height rather than pinning by-day to a column of
its own, since it runs to sixty rows against five each for by-model/by-actor,
with a **time-frame selector** (issue #334) above the grid — one `<select>`,
labelled as covering the model and actor charts, offering 1/7/30/90
days and the unlabelled lifetime default — that re-aggregates `counts.cost_rows`
client-side on change rather than re-fetching, so all the windowed charts
redraw from the same choice with no round trip; recent log; `cron.log` tail. An
option is disabled whenever its span exceeds how far back `cost_rows` actually
reaches — capped both by the Publisher's own `COST_SCAN_DAYS` truncation and,
on a younger fleet, by how long the pipeline has been running — since selecting
it would otherwise silently show the same figures as a narrower window (or as
Lifetime) without saying so; the Lifetime option itself is never disabled. A
persisted choice the control has since disabled this way (grown stale as
`cost_rows` moved) renders, and aggregates, as Lifetime instead — keeping the
selected `<option>` and the chart it drives in agreement — and reverts to the
persisted choice on its own once the window it names is available again.

Three of the panels above — the fleet-node cards, the cycle rows and the
void-item rows — are keyboard-reachable, not just clickable. Each is a plain
`<div>`/`<tr>` with none of a native control's keyboard behaviour, so each
carries `tabindex="0"`, `role="button"`, and a `keydown` handler firing on
Enter or Space in place of a click — the same activation a `<button>` gets
for free, and the reason the pull-request-reference card below is built on
`<a>` rather than either of these. Each also carries an `aria-label` naming
the action a click-derived affordance alone would not announce: "Filter
cycles and log events to `<node>`" (or "Show every node's cycles and log
events" once that filter is already active) for a fleet card, "Expand detail
for cycle started `<time>`" for a cycle row, "Expand full text for `<item>`"
for a void row. All three show the page's ordinary accent-coloured
`:focus-visible` outline on focus, matching every other focusable control on
the page.

The **GitHub API budget** panel (issue #1090) is the first section on the
page, deliberately: it answers the same question requirement 2.0's own gate
asks — is the shared rate-limit bucket about to bind — before the first
`guard-degraded` refusal shows up further down the page, not after. It
spends no `gh` call of its own: it renders `github_budget`, which the
Publisher folds from the fleet-wide `github-budget` events
`lib/github-limit.sh`'s `github_budget_record` logs at cycle start, after
every model stage and at cycle end (requirement 2.0d, agent-ops#1088) — the
same source `scripts/github-budget-report.sh` sums on demand. A full-build-
only roll-up, on `landings`'/`escape_audits`' own precedent ("The tiered
publish" above): it reads the fleet's whole history and is carried forward
unchanged on a fast tick.

`github_budget` is `{readings, latest, per_hour[], floors,
cycle_interval_minutes, about_to_bind, quiet}`:

- `readings` is the count of every `github-budget` event in the fleet-wide
  union, fleet-wide and all-time — never windowed. `0` (with every other
  field null-shaped) is the card's own **empty state**: no such event
  anywhere in the log, rendered as "nothing to report" rather than a blank
  card or an error. This is distinct from `null` (never `0`), which means
  the roll-up itself could not be assembled this tick — the same "outage, not
  a quiet night" distinction `landings`/`escape_audits` already make.
- `latest` is `{ts, core, graphql}` from the newest `readable: true` event by
  its own `ts` — also never windowed, since the point of the "meter gone
  quiet" badge below is noticing a *stale* latest reading, which a 24h window
  would silently drop instead of reporting. `core`/`graphql` are each either
  the pool's own `{limit, used, remaining, reset}` or `null` when that pool's
  read failed on an otherwise-readable event; `null` (with `readings > 0`)
  when no event has ever been readable. The panel renders both pools' used/
  limit/remaining and `reset` as a countdown, plus how long ago the reading
  was taken, followed by the same shared-bucket note the report script's own
  preamble states: while every node authenticates as one user (D25
  unprovisioned) the figures are the *bucket's*, not any one node's.
- `per_hour[]` is `{hour, readings, core_peak_used, refusals,
  budget_standdowns}` per UTC hour (`.ts[0:13]`, matching the report script's
  own `hour` grouping) — trailing 24h only, unlike `latest` above:
  `readings` and `core_peak_used` (the peak `core.used` among that hour's
  *readable* readings) come from the `github-budget` events themselves;
  `refusals` counts `guard-degraded` events matching the report script's own
  `is_refusal` predicate (a `detail` matching `rate limit (already )?exceeded`,
  case-insensitively); `budget_standdowns` counts `stand-down` events
  matching its `is_budget_standdown` predicate (`has("github_resource")`) —
  copied verbatim from `scripts/github-budget-report.sh` so the two can never
  disagree about what counts as either. Rendered as a table, newest hour
  first, the same shape the report script's own "did it bind" table prints.
- `floors` is `{core, graphql}`, copied from `config.json`'s own
  `github_min_core_budget`/`github_min_graphql_budget` (default 300/100) —
  requirement 2.0's own gate floors, read via config defaults rather than a
  value hardcoded here, so the two can never drift apart.
  `cycle_interval_minutes` is `schedule.cycle_interval_minutes` (default 15),
  the cadence source the "meter gone quiet" badge below is measured against.
- **`about_to_bind`** is `null` with no readable reading to judge (`readings
  == 0` or `latest == null`); otherwise `true` when `latest`'s `core` or
  `graphql` remaining is below its configured floor — the identical
  `remaining < floor` comparison `github_limit_verdict` itself makes, so a
  `0` floor (disabled) can never trip it, the same as the gate it mirrors.
  Renders a red **about to bind** badge.
- **`quiet`** is `null` on the empty state (`readings == 0`, nothing to
  judge); otherwise `true` when no *readable* `github-budget` event falls
  within the last two configured cycle intervals of `now` — an unreadable
  meter reads the same as no meter at all. Renders an amber **meter gone
  quiet** badge, distinct from `about_to_bind`'s red one: the two answer
  different questions (the bucket is nearly spent vs. nothing has told this
  page whether it is) and either, both or neither may be true at once.

The **Autonomous landings** panel (D18 WI-8, agent-ops#411) is the
asynchronous audit that D18 accepts unattended merging in exchange for. Risk 6
of `docs/reviews/2026-08-14-autonomy-investigation.md` — "overnight merges with
nobody watching" — is accepted deliberately, and this panel is the named
condition: the queue re-tests, `failed-runs` turns post-merge breakage back
into selectable work, and once a day a human sees everything the Script landed
without them. It is permanent rather than rollout scaffolding, because at
`agent-merges-all` it is the only routine account of what merged.

It renders `landings`, which the Publisher assembles from the fleet-wide event
union (never a private counter, so a landing armed on any node appears on every
node's page): one row per `landing-armed` inside the window — default 24 h,
overridable for tests by `LANDING_DIGEST_WINDOW_HOURS` — carrying when, the
repository, the pull request, its title and state where GitHub was read this
tick, the work source, the complexity it was armed at, the `enqueued`/
`auto-merge` method `landing_arm` actually used, and the node that armed it.

Each row is joined to the **`landing-audit-record` that justified it**
(requirement 8x, D18, agent-ops#578) — the one durable record
`_landing_stage_attempt` assembles and writes at the same moment it arms a
pull request, rather than a fact this panel re-joins from separate events
at report time. The join is by `pr_url` and the arming cycle, earliest
record at or after the arm: `_landing_stage_attempt` writes
`landing-armed` first and `landing-audit-record` second, moments apart
from the same function call, so this never has to reach further than the
earliest match at or after the arm's own timestamp. `landing-armed`
carries no pointer of its own to the record that follows it, so the cycle
every event is stamped with stands in for one: an arm and the record
written by its own call always agree on it, which is what makes a *second*
arm of the same pull request unambiguous — an arm whose record write never
completed reads as unexplained rather than borrowing the record a later
cycle wrote. A landing with no matching record still renders — its own
Record cell reading `missing`, beside (not in place of) the
classifier-escape audit's own column, rather than the tier/verdict cells
quietly reading `unknown` alone — and is called out again in its own
summary line naming how many landings in the window carry no record: an
unexplained landing is the single most important row this panel can carry,
and now that a durable per-landing record exists, "the record could not be
found" and "the record said so" read as different facts, never the same
silent null. A `landing-armed` from before requirement 8x shipped can
never have a matching record — the write it would join to did not yet
exist — so its Record cell stays `missing` permanently; its tier and
verdict still render where locatable, from the older `approver-verdict`
join this panel used before requirement 8x, kept on purely as that
fallback.

Three things it will not hide, each a way a digest could mislead by omission:

- **Refusals**, counted and grouped by reason class over the same window. Two
  landings beside forty refusals is a classifier holding the line; two beside
  none may be a gate that is not running at all. A panel showing only successes
  could not tell those apart, and the second is the one worth waking for. The
  class is the `reason` text before its first `:` (`byReason`,
  `dashboard/index.html`) — `landing_autonomy_refusal_reason`
  (`lib/landing.sh`, D18 issue #576) is what prefixes a `kill-switch:` tag onto
  a refusal only when a second, independent read of the fleet-wide kill
  switch confirms it is the actual cause of the effective level not
  qualifying, so an engaged switch groups on its own rather than folding into
  (or being indistinguishable from) the full-sentence group a level simply
  never raised forms. An open question the Reviewer could not settle
  (requirement 8f, agent-ops#668) groups the same way, on an `open-question:`
  prefix `_landing_stage_attempt`'s own new gate produces directly. Every
  refusal `_landing_stage_attempt` (`lib/landing.sh`) can produce that
  carries a `:` at all carries that `:` behind a class word of its own —
  `landing_eligible`'s and `landing_protected_path_controls_ok`'s
  `ineligible:`/`unknown:`, gate 3's `review gate:`, and the gate-by-gate
  `malformed-pr-url:`, `open-question-unreadable:`,
  `approver-review-unreadable:`, `approver-review-not-approved:`,
  `human-veto-unreadable:`, `human-changes-requested:`,
  `reconciliation-unanswered:`, `reconciliation-unreadable:`,
  `merge-queue-unreadable:`, `dequeued-actionable:`, `dequeued-manual:` and
  `arm-failed:` (TD-PPagop-26082502) — so a caller never reaches the generic
  split-on-first-`:` rule with a reason whose own varying content supplies
  the first `:` the rule ever sees. Chief among that varying content is
  `$pr_url` — itself a `https://…` string carrying its own scheme colon —
  which garbled a whole family of sentence-form refusals into one-off groups
  keyed on a URL fragment rather than on the gate that actually failed; a
  parenthetical such as `(state: …)` cut the same reason off mid-sentence for
  the same reason. A reason carrying no `:` at all — "could not read the
  Approver App's own login", "already in the merge queue" — needs no prefix:
  the whole string is already one stable group, exactly the "full-sentence
  group" a level simply never raised forms above.
- **The merge budget** (D18 issue #574), per repository: `merge_budget_per_day`'s
  effective cap against consumption, its status (`ok`/`held`/`frozen`), and,
  when held or frozen, the oldest waiting pull request and its age. An
  unlimited repository (`0`) reads as `∞`, never as a cap of zero. Consumption
  is sourced from the same rolling-24h count `lib/merge-budget.sh` itself
  reads, never a private one recomputed here: `landing-armed`,
  `merge-budget-hold` and `merge-budget-frozen` each carry the `cap`/`count`
  `merge_budget_decide` read at that decision, so the single latest of the
  three for a repository — across the whole retained log, not only this
  digest's own window, the same reasoning the audit-record join above
  already uses — is that repository's state **as of that last gate-5
  decision, not a live read**, and of unbounded age: a repository whose backlog is empty, or whose
  candidates all fail eligibility before reaching gate 5, keeps whatever event
  last fired indefinitely — what the row then *reports* from that event is
  bounded by the ageing rule below, but the event itself is never discarded. This is what keeps the freeze's own reason and the
  oldest waiting pull request visible without a live read of the freeze flag
  or `merge_budget_oldest_waiting`: both ride the
  `merge-budget-frozen`/`merge-budget-hold` event that already fires the
  moment `lib/merge-budget.sh` establishes them, rather than a second network
  call this dashboard tick has no business making. A repository this tick has
  never seen a budget decision for falls back to `config.json`'s configured
  cap, reported `ok` with nothing yet consumed — a real absence of data, not a
  claim that nothing has landed. A repository that *has* a recorded decision
  keeps that decision's own `cap` — never re-read from `config.json` — until
  its next gate-5 decision refreshes it, even if an operator edits
  `merge_budget_per_day` for that repository in the meantime: the recorded
  `cap` and `count` are read together, as the coherent pair
  `merge_budget_decide` actually reasoned from, and a superseding-cap edit
  becomes visible only once a fresh decision carries the new value alongside
  a fresh count measured against it. The `cap` outlives that pair: once the
  count beside it ages out of this digest's window (below), the recorded `cap`
  is the one field of a superseded decision the row still carries, so a
  repository whose configured cap has moved since its last gate-5 decision
  keeps reading against the old one until the next decision lands.

  `consumed` for an `ok` row is the count `merge_budget_decide` read *before*
  granting the arm that logged it — the landing the arm itself produced is
  never in it, so a repository that just spent its last permitted landing this
  window reads, for example, 7/8, not 8/8. An unlimited repository never has a
  `count` to read at all: `merge_budget_decide` short-circuits a zero cap
  before counting, so its row instead counts this digest's own `landing-armed`
  events inside the window — the same plain count the `armed`/`refused` rows
  above already give, and what this panel counted before the per-repository
  `budget` block existed. An `ok` row is aged back to unmeasured the same way
  a held row is: once its own event falls outside this digest's window, the
  count it carries has already rolled off the governor's own rolling-24h
  clock, so `consumed` resets to `0` rather than presenting a count that is no
  longer live as though it still were. A held row is aged back to `ok` on the
  identical rule, because a hold is a rolling-24h fact too, and one nothing
  has refreshed for a full window has already rolled off the governor's own
  clock; its `consumed` resets to unmeasured with it — an aged hold's `status`
  and `consumed` read exactly like a repository gate 5 has never reached,
  rather than carrying its stale count forward under a status now claiming to
  be healthy. A frozen row is never aged back this way, because a freeze
  stands until a human clears the fleet flag, not until time passes. Every held or frozen row carries the
  source event's own timestamp so the page can render its age (`held · as of
  2d ago`) rather than presenting a stale decision as current; an `ok` row
  never carries `as_of`, aged back or not, since once its count resets to
  unmeasured its `status`, `consumed` and `as_of` read as a repository gate 5
  has never reached does, which likewise has no age to show. `cap` is the one
  field that still separates the two, and only where the configured cap has
  moved since that aged decision — the persistence rule above.

  A held or frozen repository never renders folded into the plain
  `consumed/cap` text an `ok` repository gets, and never folded into the
  refusals count above either — a budget hold is not an eligibility refusal,
  even though both mean a pull request did not land that cycle. Each earns its
  own row, badged `held` or `frozen`; a `frozen` row also states why, in the
  same words `merge_budget_apply_decision` logged at the moment it froze the
  repository.
- **Its own failure.** A payload the Publisher could not assemble sets `armed`
  to `null` and renders as "could not be assembled this tick", explicitly
  distinguished from a quiet night. An empty array is a real and reportable
  nothing; `null` is an outage, and the two must never render alike.

Each `armed` row also carries the classifier-escape audit's own verdict
(requirement 8e, agent-ops#572) — `audit`, one of `"clean"`, `"escape"`,
`"unverifiable"` or `null` (not yet audited), joined by `pr_url` against the
newest `classifier-escape`/`landing-audit` event for that pull request — and
`audit_reason`, rendered as a badge on the row (green/red/amber respectively)
so a human reading one landing sees, without leaving the row, whether the
Approver's own decision was independently re-checked and what it found.
`null` reads "pending", never folded into a false "clean": a landing this
audit has not reached yet is not the same fact as one it checked and cleared.

Beside the digest, `counts.escape_audits` (requirement 8e) is the audit's own
all-time scoreboard — `checked`/`clean`/`escapes`/`unverifiable`, plus
`escape_list`/`unverifiable_list` naming each one — folded from the same
`classifier-escape`/`landing-audit` events, fleet-wide, but **never windowed**
like the digest above it: an escape is a permanent fact about one merged pull
request, and letting it age out of a 24 h window would recreate the exact
"row nobody reads" the audit exists to prevent. A payload the Publisher could
not assemble sets every field to `null`, the same "outage, not a quiet night"
distinction `armed` above makes.

The **Decisions** panel (agent-ops#937) is the same D18 pattern applied to a
decision rather than a landing: `escalation_autonomy: "decide-tactical"`
(agent-ops#936) lets the pipeline take a tactical decision on its own
authority instead of paging the owner, and this panel is the log a human can
scan in one place, alongside the lever they can pull — reopening the closed
`pw::decision` issue `lib/enabler.sh`'s `create_decision_log_issue` files for
every `decide` verdict, which vetoes the decision
(`scripts/sweep-decision-vetoes.sh`, `lib/decision-veto.sh`). It renders
`decisions`, sourced from the fleet-wide event union, never a private log:
one row per `decision-taken` event inside the window — default 7 days,
overridable for tests by `DECISIONS_DIGEST_WINDOW_DAYS` — carrying when it
was taken, the repository, the item, the decision's own text, a link to its
log issue (its own `issue_number`/`issue_url`, present unless filing it
failed, in which case the row still renders, its own cell reading "not
filed" rather than being dropped for want of one), and a status badge:
`vetoed` where a `decision-vetoed` event for the same log issue postdates it,
`pending act` where the decision carries a `decide-with-veto` act
(requirement 36f) that no `decision-acted` event has yet performed or
cancelled — the one status where the lever still changes what happens rather
than only undoing it — and `stands` otherwise. A row's `act_after` is what
the `pending act` badge names as its title, so the owner can see from the
panel alone how long they have. A payload the Publisher could not assemble sets
`decisions` to `null`, rendered as "the decisions digest could not be
assembled this tick", the same outage-not-a-quiet-night distinction `armed`
above makes; an empty window is a real, reportable "no decisions taken",
never confused with it.

The **Constraint** panel (D21, `docs/ROADMAP.md`; issue #609) leads the
page's analytics cluster — everything from here to Scorecards exists to
justify or refute the one sentence this panel states. It renders
`constraint`, assembled by `lib/constraint.sh`'s `constraint_classify` over
the node time-state account `lib/node-time-state.sh`'s `node_time_state_fold`
already produces (issue #597) — never a second fold over raw events, so it
cannot disagree with that account's own arithmetic. A payload the Publisher
could not assemble sets `constraint.sentence` (and every other field) to
`null`, rendered "the constraint statement could not be assembled this
tick", the same outage-not-a-quiet-tick distinction every other roll-up on
this page makes.

**The sentence's own grammar.** One line, always present: `<candidate's own
label> accounted for <share>% of fleet node-time between <window.from> and
<window.to>; <recommendation>`, with a grow-direction candidate's own
sentence additionally stating `(up to <effect_node_seconds>s recoverable
this window, an upper bound)` — the expected effect, in node-seconds, never
in money or a unit of delivered work (D21's own scope bound; `docs/
ROADMAP.md`'s open-questions table still has D21's numerator open). A
shrink-direction candidate's own sentence states the recommendation alone,
with no recoverable figure — shrinking does not recover producing time, it
avoids spending idle time a smaller fleet would not have had.

**The candidate table**, `constraint.candidates`, always exactly six, fixed
order, each `{key, label, evaluable, seconds, share, direction,
recommendation, effect_node_seconds, effect_note, not_evaluable_reason,
depends_on}`:

| Candidate (`key`) | Attributed from | `direction` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cron-latency` | `idle_with_demand_by_cause["awaiting-tick"]` | `grow` |
| `back-pressure` | `idle_with_demand_by_cause["back-pressure"]` | `grow` |
| `node-count` | `idle_with_demand_by_cause["peer-claimed"]` + `totals["idle-without-demand"]` | `shrink` |
| `model-capacity` | `externally_blocked_by_cause["usage-limit"]` | `grow` |
| `human-merge-gate` | never evaluable from this account (`#574`) | `null` |
| `pipeline-defect-rate` | never evaluable from this account (`#596`) | `null` |

`node-count` deliberately folds two different time-account signals into one
lever: `peer-claimed` idleness (nodes contending over a shrinking backlog)
and the fleet-wide `idle-without-demand` healthy zero (nothing eligible
anywhere) both read as "more node capacity than there is work for," and both
recommend the same fix — run fewer nodes — so folding them is what lets the
shrink case compete for `leading_candidate` on equal footing with the three
grow-side candidates, rather than being structurally unable to lead the
sentence the way a lone `idle-without-demand` reading would be (it is the
healthy zero, not a resource anything is bound on — see the roadmap's own
"a constraint is not the largest bucket" pitfall). `idle_with_demand_by_cause`'s
fourth cause, `coordinator-declined`, names no candidate here on purpose: it
is a model-selection question (D22's own "which model runs each actor"), a
different lever category from the six this item ranks. Its seconds are never
silently dropped — they render in the account breakdown beneath the sentence
(below), just never rankable as "the constraint" by this fold.

The last two candidates are never evaluable from the time account alone, and
say so on every single call, never flipping to evaluable regardless of
whether `#574`/`#596` have since landed: D21's own three-way split names
time, spend and flow as separate accounts, and the human merge gate (pull-
request wait time) and the pipeline's own defect rate (rework's tokens,
elapsed time and item counts) are spend/flow-account measures, not a
node-time-state cause this account's fold can attribute a share of
node-seconds to. Ranking them against the four time-account candidates would
need a separate attribution this item does not build — `not_evaluable_reason`
states this in the object itself, `depends_on` names the record it would
start from.

**Never the largest bucket by default.** `status` is `"ok"` or
`"insufficient-evidence"`, with `insufficient_reason` naming one of three
distinct empty states, never collapsed into one "nothing to report": `"no-
time-account-data"` (the account has no `node-state` events at all —
`window.from` is null, the state of the world before issue #597 lands, or
any window with none in it), `"window-below-minimum-sample"` (an account
exists but `expected_total_seconds` is zero, or below
`constraint_min_sample_seconds` — too little observed to trust any share
computed from it; zero is stated separately because it is below *any*
minimum, `constraint_min_sample_seconds: 0` included, and because it is what
a single `node-state` event produces — a zero-length window, and so every
candidate's `share` null while `window.from` is not), and `"no-
candidate-above-minimum-share"` (a sufficient sample, but every evaluable
candidate's own share is below `constraint_min_share` — the sentence still
names the largest observed candidate, as context, but `leading_candidate`
stays `null`). `constraint_min_share` (default `0.3`) and
`constraint_min_sample_seconds` (default `14400`) are `config.json` keys,
echoed back on the object so a reader can see what gated the verdict without
a second lookup; `cadence_bound_minutes` (`schedule.cycle_interval_minutes`)
rides beside them purely informationally — the same resolution floor
`scripts/pickup-metrics.sh` states beside its own figures, never a gate this
fold applies itself.

**The account's own breakdown by state**, `constraint.account` — the same
shape `scripts/node-time-state.sh` prints, `window`/`totals`/
`expected_total_seconds`/`balanced`/`idle_with_demand_by_cause`/
`externally_blocked_by_cause`/`by_node` — renders beneath the sentence and
the candidate table as the evidence for or against it, never a second
verdict of its own: the totals table (all six states plus `unaccounted`),
then the idle-with-demand cause breakdown, then the externally-blocked cause
breakdown. `externally_blocked_by_cause` (issue #609) is the one addition
`node_time_state_fold` itself gained for this item — `externally-blocked`
seconds split by its own eight causes, `usage-limit` isolated from the other
seven so the account can tell "model capacity is the constraint" from "a
host or GitHub fault is," on the same terms `idle_with_demand_by_cause`
already split idle-with-demand seconds by its own four causes. **The window
is the retained log union and nothing more** — `log.jsonl` and
`review-log.jsonl` are both unioned and neither is ever rotated by size
(requirement 2.6), so every share this panel states is honestly "over the
node-state history this fleet still has," the same bound every other
history roll-up on this page already carries.

`scripts/constraint.sh` is the read-only CLI a human or another tool can run
directly — `lib/constraint.sh`'s own header is the field-by-field contract,
mirrored here rather than duplicated. It is never called from this panel's
own render path; the Publisher computes `constraint` once per full build,
exactly as it does `rework` and the actor scorecards, and the page only ever
reads the payload.

The **Fleet sizing** panel (D21/D14, `docs/ROADMAP.md`; issue #612) sits
directly under Constraint, as the per-node evidence behind that panel's own
`node-count` candidate: `constraint` states one fleet-wide bucket, this
states which node, if any, is the one to remove. It renders `fleet_sizing`,
assembled by `lib/fleet-sizing.sh`'s `fleet_sizing_classify` over three
inputs, none of them a second raw-event scan of a fold this page already
paid for: the same node time-state account `constraint` itself reads
(`by_node[node]["idle-without-demand"]`); `lib/fleet-sizing.sh`'s own
`fleet_sizing_contention_by_node`, the identical selection/contended-
claim-lost population `scripts/pickup-metrics.sh` already counts
(TD-PPagop-26080808), grouped by node instead of by adoption era; and
`lib/fleet-sizing.sh`'s own `fleet_sizing_exclusive_landings_by_node` over
`item_lifecycle_fold`'s own records — a landed item whose only competing
`claim-lost` events (if any) came from its own claiming node is "exclusive":
no peer would have taken it. A payload the Publisher could not assemble sets
`fleet_sizing.sentence` (and every other field) to `null`, the same
outage-not-a-quiet-tick discipline `constraint` itself follows.

**The verdict, per node**, `fleet_sizing.by_node[]`, each `{node,
idle_without_demand_seconds, idle_share, claim_lost_contended, selections,
claim_lost_share, exclusive_landings, total_landings, verdict,
recommendation, lever}`. `idle_share` is that node's own
idle-without-demand seconds over the window's own length — a *time* share;
`claim_lost_share` is that node's own contended `claim-lost` count over the
**fleet-wide** pool of contended losses — a *pool* share, deliberately a
different kind of denominator, since "how much of this node's own time was
idle" and "how much of the fleet's own contention does this node account
for" are different questions the fold answers separately rather than
blending into one number. `verdict` is `"shrink-candidate"` only when all
three of idle share, claim-lost share and exclusive landings cross their own
threshold at once — high idle time or high contention alone is not enough,
and a node that is idle and contended but still delivers exclusive work is
earning its place regardless. `recommendation` is non-null only on a
shrink-candidate, naming the node and its own evidence in one sentence;
`lever` states the decision every row informs either way — "run fewer
nodes" on a shrink-candidate, "no action indicated" (with the reason) on a
healthy one — the lever rule (D21) applied per row, not only to the
fleet-wide sentence above it.

**The thresholds**, echoed on the object so a reader can see what gated the
verdict without a second lookup: `min_idle_share` and `min_claim_lost_share`
(default `0.3` each, the same default `constraint_min_share` uses, for the
same "roughly a third" reading of "elevated") and
`max_exclusive_landings_for_shrink` (default `0` — "few exclusive landings"
read at its strictest). **Never a guess below the evidence floor**: the same
`status`/`insufficient_reason` shape `constraint` uses, with one addition —
`"too-few-nodes"` (fewer than two nodes recorded; a shrink candidate needs
at least one peer to have contended with, which a single-node fleet cannot
supply) alongside `"no-time-account-data"` and
`"window-below-minimum-sample"` (`min_sample_seconds`, default `14400`, the
same default `constraint_min_sample_seconds` uses). `shrink_candidates` is
the plain list of node names `verdict == "shrink-candidate"`, `[]` — never
omitted — when the fleet is not indicated as over-provisioned by this
measure; the sentence states which reading applies in words.

The **Revert rate by repository** panel (D18 issue #579) is the continuous
half of Stage 2's exit criterion ("revert rate ≤ baseline"):
`scripts/mine-merge-history.sh` produced that criterion's Stage 0 baseline
once, by hand, on 2026-08-15, and nothing measured it again until this panel —
a regression is now a reportable fact on the day it happens, not only at a
promotion review. It renders `revert_rate`, which the Publisher assembles the
same way `landings` is: a fleet-wide union read over `revert-rate.jsonl`
(never rotated, replicated exactly like `log.jsonl` — `scripts/publish-
revert-rate.sh`'s own daily tick appends one row per repository, per node),
reduced to the newest row per repository across every node by that row's own
`ts` (union-with-most-recent-event-wins, the same rule the blocked and void
extractions use over `log.jsonl`), then joined against `config.repos` so a
repository whose publishing tick has never once succeeded still gets a row —
`{repo}` alone, no other keys — rather than silently vanishing from the
table. A join failure (the whole read could not be assembled) sets
`revert_rate` to `null`, rendered "could not be assembled this tick" and
explicitly distinguished from every repository simply having no data yet, on
the same "its own failure" principle the landings panel above uses.

Each row states three figures, per repository:

- **Rolling window** — the day-of operational signal: every merged, labelled
  pull request in the last `window_days` (14 by default) whose own 48-hour
  post-merge observation window has already elapsed, i.e. excluding anything
  merged in the last 48 hours, floored at `min_samples` (10) before a rate
  renders at all. Below the floor, the row states the sample size and that it
  is under the floor instead of a rate a reader would over-read from a
  handful of pull requests. The window's cadence and its own two instants
  (`rolling.since` .. `rolling.excludes_merged_after`) both render beneath the
  figure, in muted text, so a reader never has to hold the cadence in their
  head, and a row a node stopped publishing weeks ago does not read as
  current: the second instant is the "now" the rate is actually current as
  of, minus the 48 hours it excludes.
- **Cumulative since baseline** — every merged, labelled pull request since
  `revert_rate_baseline.generated`, unfiltered. This is the figure Stage 2's
  own exit criterion reads: an all-population aggregate compared against the
  all-population baseline it was measured the same way. Its own `since` date
  renders beneath it, same as the rolling window's bounds.
- **Baseline** — the stored Stage 0 figures themselves
  (`config.json`'s `revert_rate_baseline`, copied in once from `docs/reviews/
  2026-08-15-merge-autonomy-baseline.md` rather than re-derived at runtime).

A `vs baseline` badge compares cumulative against baseline — the two measured
the same way — green `at/below baseline` or red `above baseline`; a
repository absent from `revert_rate_baseline.repos` (or missing the whole
`revert_rate_baseline` block) renders neither figure nor badge as a rate,
reading `no data` rather than a comparison against nothing. All three figures
render as a percentage with the sample size that produced it (`25% (n=12)`),
never a bare percentage a reader cannot judge the weight of.

The **Rework** panel (D23, `docs/ROADMAP.md`; issue #611) answers exactly
three questions from the rework record and the item lifecycle record
(`docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md`, requirements 47 and 49) and adds nothing else. It
renders `rework`, assembled by `lib/rework-panel.sh`'s `rework_panel_build`
from the same fleet-wide event union `escape_audits` above already reads,
and — like that panel, never `revert_rate`'s own rolling window — **never
windowed**: which rung eventually caught a given defect is a permanent fact
about it, on the same argument `escape_audits`' own paragraph above makes for
never letting an escape age out of a 24 h window. A payload the Publisher
could not assemble sets every top-level field to `null`
(`{how_much: null, whose: null, escape_ladder: null, clean_count: null,
rework_cycles: null}` — the last of those is not a fourth question but the
cycle-id set this fold's own cost join already computed, lifted to the top
level so the Spend by fate panel below can classify a `cost_rows[]` row as
rework by the identical membership test rather than re-deriving it, issue
#612),
the same "outage, not a quiet log" distinction every other roll-up on this
page makes — and so does a fold that aborted part-way, which
`rework_panel_build` reports with that same shape rather than with the
all-zero one. The two are opposite claims — nothing to report, versus nothing
was computed — and never render alike. A missing, empty or unreadable log is
the former: the fold runs to completion over an empty stream and its all-zero
report is the true statement "no rework recorded."

D23 is emphatic that rework is never a target of zero — a Reviewer catching
a defect is the system working, not failing — so this panel never collapses
its three questions into one score a reader could misread as "rework good,
rework bad":

- **How much?** `how_much.tokens`/`.elapsed_ms`/`.cost_usd`, each
  `{total, rework, rework_share}` — the fleet's whole per-cycle spend
  (`stage-end`'s own `cost_usd`/`duration_ms`/`tokens.*`, summed null-as-zero
  per `docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md`, joined to a `rework` event by the `cycle`
  field both carry from the same `log_event` envelope) against the subset
  spent on a cycle that also carries at least one rework record. That join is
  cycle-granular and the page says so in those words beneath the figure: a
  `stage-end` meters a stage, and the rework record does not say which part
  of a cycle a repetition consumed, so no apportionment within a cycle is
  derivable and a rework-bearing cycle counts in full — `rework_share` is an
  upper bound on what repetition cost, never a measured split, and a reader
  meets that sentence on the panel rather than only here.
  `how_much.first_pass_yield` is `{landed_total, first_pass, yield}` —
  `first_pass` is deliberately the narrow, literal reading issue #611's own
  refinement specifies: a landed item with **zero rework records whose
  `attributed_stage` is non-null**, not zero rework records of any class. A
  landed item that bounced once on `review-round-trip` (attribution `null`,
  D23's own attribution rule) still counts as first-pass by this definition
  — including, perhaps surprisingly, an item whose only rework record is a
  `post-merge-revert` (also unattributed): the worst outcome the ladder below
  can show still reads as "first-pass" here, because attribution and outcome
  severity are two different axes and this figure reads only the former.
  `how_much.rework_count` is the raw, deduped rework record count, reported
  once more explicitly for the same reason the escape ladder's own `caught`
  figures are — see the signature below. Every *count* on this panel
  (`rework_count`, `whose`, the escape ladder) reads a stream reduced
  first-wins-by-`ts` on the record's own stable identity, per
  `docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md`'s "Do not double-count": `{repo, item, class}`,
  plus `evidence.by` for `post-merge-revert` (more than one corrective pull
  request can be detected for the same original), plus `ts` and `evidence`
  for the fleet-wide classes that carry neither `repo` nor `item` (crash-loop
  escalation, a backstop `stage-rerun`) — which without that narrowing would
  share one key across the whole log's history and collapse every occurrence
  of the class, for all time, to the first ever recorded. The rework *spend*
  in `how_much` reads the stream before that reduction, since each copy names
  the cycle its own node really spent tokens in; deduping there would drop a
  cycle that genuinely did rework and make the upper bound above an
  undercount instead.
- **Whose?** `whose.by_attributed_stage` — one `{stage, count}` row per
  non-null `attributed_stage` value actually present (today: `reviewer`,
  from `human-change-request`, and whichever stage names its own
  `stage-rerun`) — plus `whose.not_attributed`, `{count, by_class}`: the
  seven classes `docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md`'s own attribution rule leaves `null`
  by design, broken down by class. Never inferred: a class with no
  detector-supplied attribution stays in `not_attributed` here exactly as it
  does in the record itself.
- **How far did it get?** `escape_ladder`, one row per detection stage in
  the pipeline's own rising cost order — `agent-review` (every class but the
  two below: a Reviewer or an earlier stage catching something before a
  human ever looks), `human-gate` (`human-change-request` — the
  reconciliation gate's own dirty verdict at the Reviewer's handoff),
  `post-merge` (`post-merge-revert` — nothing caught it until a corrective
  pull request landed after merge). Each row is
  `{stage, population, caught, escaped, escape_rate, cost_to_catch_at_next,
  cost_to_catch_at_next_note}`. The ladder's population is deliberately
  narrower than "every landed item": only landed items with **at least one
  caught defect, at any rung** — a landed item with zero rework records of
  any class may have had zero real defects, or one nothing here ever caught,
  and the two are indistinguishable from this record alone, so this panel
  does not guess which. That excluded population is `clean_count`, reported
  once, separately, rather than folded into a rate that would otherwise
  overstate how much passed undetected. `caught` at a rung is
  **item-granular, not defect-granular**: a rework record carries no defect
  identity (`docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md`), so every item is first collapsed to the
  single furthest rung any of its own rework records reached, and only then
  is `caught` tallied as the landed items whose furthest rung was this row —
  never a count of the defects actually caught there. An item carrying two
  independent defects — one bounced back at `agent-review`, a second nothing
  caught until `post-merge` — credits only the `post-merge` row:
  `agent-review`'s own `caught` count is unaffected by the round trip that
  did catch something, despite that catch being real, and that same item
  counts toward `agent-review`'s `escaped` instead. `test/rework-panel.test.sh`'s
  item 4 is exactly this shape. Read every per-rung `caught` figure — and, by
  extension, the `population` each later rung inherits from the rung before
  its own `escaped` items, since that population is built from the same
  furthest-rung collapse — as a **floor** on the defects actually caught or
  outstanding there, never an exact count. The escape-rate signature itself
  stays legible under this reading (see "The Reviewer-waving-work-through
  signature" below): the collapse is pessimistic about an active Reviewer,
  crediting it with nothing on exactly the item this paragraph describes, so
  the direction of the bias only ever understates catches, never invents
  them. `escape_rate` at a rung is the share
  of that rung's own population — items not yet caught when they reached
  it — that went on uncaught to a later rung; `post-merge` is terminal and
  reports `escaped`/`escape_rate` as `null`, never a `0` that would misread
  as "always caught here." `cost_to_catch_at_next` is the average
  tokens/elapsed-time/cost of the cycles that caught a defect at the row's
  own next rung (the same per-cycle metering join `how_much` uses) — `null`
  with its own `cost_to_catch_at_next_note` explaining why: `post-merge`'s
  row states "terminal rung, nothing further to escape to," while
  `human-gate`'s row states that a `post-merge-revert` record carries no
  `cycle` at all (mined after the fact, outside any cycle,
  `docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md`) and so its cost is genuinely unmeasurable — a
  different reason for the same `null`, and the panel never conflates them.
  A catch whose own `cycle` the log carries no `stage-end` for (a peer's log
  that failed to fetch, a cycle whose stage events no longer survive) is
  dropped from that average rather than folded in as a zero-cost sample, so
  `n` counts the catches actually measured and never the catches that
  happened; a rung with catches but metering for none of them reads `null`
  with the note "no human-gate catch with metered cycle spend in this window
  to measure," on the same "an outage is not a quiet zero" distinction every
  other roll-up on this page makes.

**The Reviewer-waving-work-through signature.** A rising escape rate at the
`agent-review` rung alongside a *falling* `caught` count at that same row is
the signature D23 warns a naive reader could mistake for improvement: a
Reviewer that stops bouncing work back looks, by that one figure alone, like
a Reviewer catching fewer defects — when the defects still happen and
simply surface later, at a more expensive rung. This panel never blends
`caught` and `escape_rate` into one score for exactly that reason: reading
them side by side on the same row is what keeps the regression legible
rather than cancelling out. `test/rework-panel.test.sh` demonstrates this
directly against a constructed before/after fixture, on
`test/item-lifecycle.test.sh`'s own precedent of a hand-built log exercising
every case at once.

**A residual coverage gap, stated on the panel's own face** (issue #611's
own correction to its original filing, which had named a different, already-
resolved gap — agent-ops#533, `lib/reconciliation-gate.sh`, PR #539): the
`human-gate` rung can only see what the reconciliation gate itself observes,
at the Reviewer's own ready handoff. A human change request posted *after* a
pull request is already ready, or acted on directly with no handoff ever
running, is invisible to that detector, and the Enabler's own handoff-
recovery path shares the identical check but emits only a `warning`, never a
`rework` record, on a dirty verdict there (`TD-PPagop-26082919`, parked as a
Phase 2 attribution question, not a gap this panel closes). The page states
this immediately beneath the escape ladder, in the same words, so a reader
never mistakes the `human-gate` row's own count for a complete one.

The **Doctor** panel (agent-ops#543) renders `status.doctor`: the most recent
hourly `scripts/doctor.sh --unattended` pass on *this* node, read from
`state_dir/.doctor-status.json` rather than recomputed — its GitHub section is
too expensive to repeat on the dashboard's own 5-minute heartbeat, so a
separate hourly `crontab.tmpl` line runs it and this Publisher just reads the
result. One row per `fail`/`warn` line the pass printed, each carrying a
level badge (`fail` red, `warn` amber) and the message verbatim, plus when the
pass last ran; a clean pass says so instead of rendering an empty table, and
no pass having run yet (a node whose image predates the flag, or one still on
its first hour) says that too, rather than either looking identical to a
clean pass. A `fail` or `warn` also raises its own page-top banner (naming the
count and pointing at this section), the same way failing PR checks do —
because, like those, a `warn` this pass leaves unclaimed the same way a
misconfigured `Priority` field did before this existed is otherwise invisible
between one operator-invoked `doctor.sh` and the next.

Above the fail/warn table, a standing line (agent-ops#694) states this node's
PAT expiry once any unattended pass has recorded one:
`token_expiry.days_remaining` and `.expires_at`, read from GitHub's own
`GitHub-Authentication-Token-Expiration` response header. Unlike the
fail/warn rows, this line renders whenever `token_expiry` is non-null,
including on an otherwise-clean pass — it is a figure this node always has an
answer for, not a message that only appears when something is wrong. A badge
reads amber below `TOKEN_EXPIRY_WARN_DAYS` (7; `lib/token-expiry.sh`) and grey
at or above it, with a rotate-`GH_TOKEN` nudge alongside the amber reading;
`token_expiry: null` (an installation token, or any other
credential GitHub states no expiry for) renders nothing here at all. This is
the dashboard half of the warning the 2026-08-22 fleet-wide outage
(agent-ops#691) needed and never had — the expiry date was knowable a month
out, and every node lost GitHub at once, misdiagnosed as an outage, before an
operator noticed hours later.

This panel itself renders only this node's own `status.doctor` — a
repository's configuration and this node's own GitHub access are this
node's alone to report, so a peer's doctor pass has nothing to add here.
`doctor`'s own *verdict* does now travel in `fleet.nodes[].doctor`, the same
way `compose`/`image`/`switch` already did, and since agent-ops#1397 a
bounded `fails` travels beside it — the first three entries, each truncated
to 200 characters, so that a page can name the check that failed without the
whole fleet re-fetching unbounded diagnostic prose every
`schedule.state_sync_fetch_minutes`. `warns`, `skips` and `token_expiry`
stay node-local still. All of that is for `lib/pager.sh`'s own
`verdict-unanimous` invariant (implementation spec requirement 51) to read
fleet-wide, not for this panel, which stays node-local by design.

The **Stage health** panel (agent-ops#662) renders `status.stage_health`: the
most recent per-stage verdict computed on *this* node, read from
`state_dir/.stage-health.json` (written by `lib/stage-health.sh`'s
`stage_health_write_status` at the end of every cycle, and — for the
`monitor` row alone — at the end of every Pipeline Monitor run that engaged
its stage, `docs/MONITOR-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` M17) rather than
recomputed, on `status.doctor`'s own precedent just above. One row per stage
(`coordinator`, `approver`, `approver-adjudicate-open-question`,
`enabler-adjudicate`, `enabler-decide`, `enabler`, `refiner`, `implementer`,
`reviewer`, `monitor`),
each carrying a verdict badge (`failing` red,
`idle` grey, `ok` green), when it last succeeded, and — for a `failing`
row — its consecutive-failure count and the most recent attempt's own
failure detail; no cycle having completed since this check shipped says so,
rather than rendering an empty table. A `failing` row also raises its own
page-top banner naming which stage(s), the same way a `doctor` `fail` does —
this is the reading that was missing entirely during the 2026-08-21
incident (issue #662): `cycle: RUNNING` and a clean Doctor pass both stayed
true while every stage failed for 10.5 hours, because neither reads a
stage's own `exit_code`.

The panel, the fleet-strip badge and the banner all iterate whatever keys
`stages` actually holds rather than a fixed list, which is what lets the
`monitor` row appear beside the implementation pipeline's nine without a
render change: `monitor-cycle.sh` computes the verdict for `["monitor"]` over
its own `monitor-log.jsonl` and **merges** it into the same file, so the two
writers each replace only their own stages and carry the other's forward
(`docs/MONITOR-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` M17). What the Monitor pipeline *found* is
not on this page at all — its dated report lives in the state store — and
surfacing it is deferred at `tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26091101.md`.

A non-empty `pager` array (implementation spec requirement 51) raises its
own page-top banner, `.banner.pager-firing` — a fourth colour modifier
alongside `.amber`/`.green`/`.red`, since a firing invariant is neither an
ordinary warning nor a clean pass — naming every firing key and its
evidence, each linking `issue_url` when the tracking issue exists. For each
entry that carries a `nodes` array, every node card named in it gets a
badge (`b-purple`, the same purple family as the `.banner.pager-firing`
banner above) reading the invariant's own key, titled with its evidence — so a
`verdict-unanimous` page naming every active node marks every one of their
cards, while an invariant with no `nodes` (most of `page-outlived-item`'s
own firings, which are about an issue, not a node) raises the banner alone.

Unlike `status.doctor`, this verdict is not local to the node that computed
it: `scripts/state-sync.sh`'s heartbeat carries it as `stage_health`, on the
same terms as the compose/image/switch verdicts, so the fleet strip's own
**N stage(s) failing** badge (above) can render for a peer, not only for this
page's own node — a peer's badge comes from its heartbeat's `stage_health`
field or renders nothing at all, never a verdict this page derives for that
peer.

The **Actor and model scorecards** panel renders `counts.actor_scorecards`
(issue #610, D22) — one card per actor with a model choice (D12), one row per
model and tier, graded on **outcome**: what a stage-end's own attempts
*produced*, not how many of them there were. It supersedes the Co-Ordinator
verdict-quality panel (issue #319 — its corroboration rate is folded into the
Co-Ordinator card's own `measure` rather than left rendering beside it) and
the two "model used" pies (issue #529 — that ratio is now every row's own
`attempts`, split by model and tier rather than drawn as a chart of its own).

Every row's outcome figures — `landed`/`voided`/`abandoned`, first-pass yield,
cost and wall-clock per landed item — are joined through
`lib/item-lifecycle.sh`'s own fold (requirement 49) over the subset of that
row's stage-ends that carry `{repo, item}`: the Implementer's and Reviewer's
always do, the Enabler's two per-item adjudication stages do, and the
Co-Ordinator's own engagement and the top-level Enabler's and Refiner's own
do not — each spans several items in one engagement, so `items_examined`
reads `0` there by construction and that actor's own measure (below) is built
from a different, genuinely per-item event instead. That subset is reduced to
distinct `{repo, item}` **once per row**, not once per stage name feeding it:
a row can be fed by more than one stage — the Enabler's `critical` row by both
`enabler-adjudicate` and `enabler-decide` — and an item that met both would
otherwise count as two examined items and, if it landed, two landed ones,
halving that row's own cost-per-landed. Cost and wall-clock still sum across
every one of that item's own stage-ends in the row; only the item count is
deduplicated. `landed_with_rework`
reads a landed item's deduped `rework` records (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md, "Do not
double-count") for one whose own `attributed_stage` names this row's actor —
today that is only ever non-empty for a `stage-rerun` (any actor) or a
`human-change-request` (Reviewer only), per that document's own "Attribution"
section; every other class carries `attributed_stage: null` and so never
moves a row from `landed_unchanged` to `landed_with_rework`. `attempts`/
`clean` count *every* stage-end for the row's stage name(s), item-carrying or
not, so the Co-Ordinator's and the top-level Enabler's/Refiner's own
engagements are not undercounted the way restricting to the joinable subset
would; `clean` is a stage-end with no `kill_reason` — the other half of
`stage-rerun`, a fleet-wide crash-loop escalation, cannot be pinned to one
attempt among several sharing a stage and node and is not subtracted here.

Cost and wall-clock per landed item read the landed stage-end's own
`cost_usd`/`duration_ms` (docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md) directly, summed across
every stage-end that touched the item and divided by items landed — not
`counts.cost_rows[]`, whose own `attributed` field is `false` by construction
for the Enabler and the Refiner (they share their triggering cycle's id with
whichever stage of that cycle owns the item), which would leave those two
actors' cost/wall-clock permanently null.

Each actor's own **measure** answers the question specific to it, D22's own
list: the **Co-Ordinator's** is issue #319's own corroboration rate, folded in
here per model rather than left as its own panel — `corroborated`/`rejected`/
`rate`, plus whether the items it picked (`selection`) went on to land,
`picks_landed` of `picks_total`. That is two rates over two different
populations, so each carries its own gate rather than sharing one: `status`
answers for the corroboration rate over `corroborated`, `picks_status` for the
picks-landed rate over `picks_total`. A row can have verdict history enough to
state a rejection rate and two picked items — a landing rate off two picks is
the spurious ordering "stratify or abstain" exists to refuse, and it must not
reach the page on the strength of the *other* rate's sample.
The **Reviewer's** is an escape rate:
items — not raw rework records — carrying a deduped `human-change-request` or
`post-merge-revert` record against items reviewed; a `post-merge-revert`
record's own `item` is the reverted pull request's number, not the work item a
stage-end names, so it is re-keyed onto the work item via `pr_url`
(`pr-raised`/`pr-ready` already carry both) before the join, and is left
unjoined — excluded from every row — where no such mapping is on record. The
**Enabler's** is unblock success: `landed` of `items_examined`, the same two
figures its own row already states. The **Refiner's** is refinement success:
items it refined (`item-refined` events carrying `by: "refiner"` — the
Enabler logs the same event, with no `by`, for its own unblock-as-refined act,
and is excluded here) against how many were later bounced back
(docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md's `refinement-bounce-back`) — never the Refiner's own
stage-end attempts, since that engagement spans several items and has no
per-item identity of its own to count.

**Stratify or abstain** (D22): every row states its own `sample` — `landed` +
`voided` + `abandoned`, the closed population its rate is drawn from — and
`status`, `"insufficient-sample"` below `counts.actor_scorecards.min_sample`
(`lib/verdict-fate.sh`'s own `MIN_SAMPLE` default of 5, agent-ops#573, reused
rather than a second threshold invented for this card) or `"ok"` otherwise;
below the minimum the row's first-pass yield, cost and wall-clock read
"insufficient evidence" rather than a number too thin to mean anything. A
row's own `measure` carries the same gate on its own sample — and one gate per
rate it states, not one per measure, since the populations are often different:
the Co-Ordinator's corroborated-verdict count is rarely the same as its
picked-item count. A row's **stratum** is its
own `model` and `tier`: Implementer splits `trivial`/`default`, Reviewer
`default`/`complex`, Enabler `default`/`critical` by stage name
(`enabler` vs. `enabler-adjudicate`/`enabler-decide`); the Co-Ordinator and
the Refiner each have one configured model and so one tier, `default`. Tier
is derived by comparing a stage-end's own `model` id against that actor's two
*currently* configured tier values — there is no per-event record of which
config key resolved it at the time — so a historical run under a
since-changed mapping reads `"unmapped"` rather than a guess.

The card ships even on a log with no stage-end for any of the five actors,
each carrying `rows: []` rather than the card itself going missing — the page
distinguishes "nothing recorded in this window" from "this Publisher never
recorded any of this," and a `data.js` written before the aggregate existed
says so outright rather than rendering a clean-looking empty card set it has
no data for.

The **Token economics** panel (issue #594, D21) surfaces the token dimension
`lib/metering.sh` records on every stage and nothing before this read: two
breakdowns, **by stage** and **by model**, each a table of input/output/
cache-read/cache-write token totals plus the **prompt-cache ratio** —
`cache_read / (cache_read + cache_creation + input)`, stated in the table
header itself rather than left for a reader to infer, since an unstated
denominator is exactly the "counter on a wall" the lever rule (D21) forbids.
Both ride `counts.cost_rows[]` and the cost charts' own time-frame selector
(`windowedTokenBreakdown`, mirroring `windowedCostBreakdown`) — the same
window, moved by the same control, so a reader who narrows the time frame to
answer "what did yesterday cost" gets the same narrowing applied to "what did
yesterday's tokens buy." A `cost_rows[]` row whose four `tokens_*` fields are
all `null` (an `unknown`-model row with no readable `modelUsage`) is excluded
from both breakdowns entirely, never folded in as zero — see
`docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md`.

Each row's own `n` counts distinct transcripts, deduped by `(cycle, actor)`
rather than by `cycle` alone (`aggregateTokenRows`, issue #1591): the by-stage
breakdown's own groups are already one actor each, so that pair reduces to
`cycle` there and its `n` is unaffected, but the by-model breakdown groups by
model, where a cycle whose several actors share one model must count as that
many distinct transcripts, not one — a `cycle`-only dedup, correct for
`aggregateCostRows`'s own `by_actor`/`by_model` totals above, would undercount
it here.

Each row's own cache ratio carries the lever the figure informs, in the same
cell: below `TOKEN_MIN_SAMPLE` (5, the same minimum sample the actor/model
scorecards already use) it reads "insufficient evidence" rather than a rate
too thin to mean anything; at or above it, a ratio below
`CACHE_RATIO_ACTION_THRESHOLD` (0.5, stated on the page rather than left a
mystery number per implementation spec requirement 4f) names the lever
directly — the stage's own prompt prefix may be varying between cycles, worth
stabilising or revisiting its `prompts/` override — and a ratio at or above it
reads "no action indicated." Each breakdown also names its own largest token
consumer in a caption above the table — the actor or model whose D12
assignment is driving the token cost, the lever the by-stage/by-model split
itself informs.

The **Stall profile** panel (issue #594, D21) renders `counts.stage_gaps`: the
other series `lib/metering.sh` records and nothing read before this — how long
each stage went silent, by stage. It states its own window
(`window_from`/`window_to`) above the table, deliberately not the cost charts'
`COST_SCAN_DAYS`: its source is the `gaps` object on `stage-end`/
`review-stage-end` events in the retained log union, a materially different —
usually longer — span (`docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md`). The caption also states,
in words, that `median_of_run_p50` and `worst_run_p95` are read "across runs"
rather than as pooled percentiles, and that `worst_run_max` alone is exact (a
max of maxima is a max) — the same distinction `docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md`'s own
`gaps` section draws, restated here since it is the one place on the page a
reader could otherwise mistake a per-run figure for a fleet-wide percentile.

Each row's own **Decision** cell is the lever the stall profile informs (D21):
whether the stage-cap settings the watchdog enforces (implementation spec
requirement 4e) should move, and which way. `worst_run_max` is compared
against `stageBackstopMin` — the same figure the fleet strip's own
stage-overrun badge already holds a live stage against, so this panel cannot
recommend a number the rest of the page would disagree with — **before** the
sample-size check, and independently of it: `worst_run_max` is a max of
maxima, not a rate, so it is exact at any sample size, including a single
run. At or above `STALL_NEAR_BACKSTOP_RATIO` (0.9) of that backstop the cell
names the lever directly — raise the backstop before a healthy run is
killed — no matter how few runs the row carries. Only below that ratio does
the sample size matter: under `TOKEN_MIN_SAMPLE` runs the cell reads
"insufficient evidence"; at or above it, "no action indicated." A row whose
`stageBackstopMin` resolves to no positive number — no per-row announced
value, no entry for that stage in the published `config.stage_backstops`
(see the fast-tick section's note on stage budgets and issue #1586, so that
`config.stage_backstops` can carry a `project-reviewer` entry; this now covers
`project-reviewer`, and `refiner` the same way, once the fleet-wide fold has
observed a stage-end for it), and no shipped prior for that stage name —
reads "no cap on record for this stage" rather than guessing a direction.

The **Spend by fate** panel (D21/D14, `docs/ROADMAP.md`; issue #612) is the
other half of "where do the tokens go?" — the fate account `docs/
ROADMAP.md`'s own D21 accounting decision calls for, whereas Token economics
and the Stall profile above answer "how efficiently" and "how quiet," this
answers "on what." It renders `spend_fate`, assembled by
`lib/fleet-pricing.sh`'s `fleet_pricing_spend_fate` over the same
`counts.cost_rows[]` the cost charts and Token economics already read, this
time joined against `lib/rework-panel.sh`'s own `rework_cycles` (issue #611's
cycle-membership test, never re-derived) and `item_lifecycle_fold`'s own
per-item terminal fate, both already computed elsewhere on the page. Unlike
Token economics this panel is **not** windowed by the cost charts' own
time-frame selector: a row's fate is a permanent fact about it, the same
"never windowed" argument the escape-ladder and rework panels above already
make for a caught defect's own rung.

Both `counts.cost_rows[]` and `rework_cycles` reach `fleet_pricing_spend_fate`
spooled to a file in `$work_tmp` and read via `--slurpfile` (issue #1691),
never as an `--argjson` value on `jq`'s own argv — the class requirement 4g
exists for, since a fleet's rework-bearing-cycle count is unbounded by
configuration and rides this join all-time. When `rework_panel_build` itself
reports its outage shape (`rework_cycles: null` — a fold that aborted, the
Rework panel's own paragraph above), that `null` is passed through verbatim,
never coalesced to `[]`: `fleet_pricing_spend_fate` reports its own all-null
outage shape in that case rather than computing a confident, reconciled
account with every rework-bearing row silently reclassified into
delivered/discarded/defect_driven — the same "an outage is not a quiet zero"
discipline every other roll-up on this page keeps.

**The fate mapping**, applied in this order, first match wins, so every row
lands in exactly one of six buckets — never dropped, never double-counted
(`lib/fleet-pricing.sh`'s own header carries the full reasoning; this is the
summary a reader of the page needs):

| Order | Fate | A row matches when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `overhead` | `attributed` is false, or `repo`/`item` are both empty even though `attributed` is true (a coordinator cycle that selected nothing, stood down, was skipped, or simply ended) |
| 2 | `rework` | the row's own `cycle` is one `rework_panel_build`'s own `rework_cycles` names |
| 3 | `defect_driven` | `outcome == "failed"` (an attempt errored outright) and not already claimed by rework |
| 4 | `delivered` | the row's `{repo, item}` terminal fate, from `item_lifecycle_fold`, is `landed` |
| 4 | `discarded` | that terminal fate is `voided`, `superseded` or `abandoned` |
| 4 | `unaccounted` | anything else — `blocked`, `open`, an item lifecycle itself reports `unaccounted`, or an item this fold's population never saw: not yet resolved, never a forced guess between delivered and discarded |

**The `rework` bucket and the Rework panel's own `cost_usd.rework` are not
the same figure, and are not meant to reconcile against each other.** They
share issue #611's cycle-membership test and nothing else: the Rework panel
sums `stage-end` cost per cycle, over every row of a rework-bearing cycle,
while this account sums `cost_rows[]` (transcript × model) and sends a
rework-bearing cycle's *unattributed* rows — an Enabler, a Refiner, a
limit probe sharing that cycle id — to `overhead` instead, because rule 1
outranks rule 2. The bucket is therefore the narrower of the two by
construction. Each answers its own question against its own source; a reader
comparing them is comparing "what did rework-bearing cycles cost" with "what
did rework cost the work that was attributable to an item."

**Reconciliation is checked, not asserted**: `spend_fate.reconciled` is
`true` iff the six buckets' own *unrounded* sums add to
`spend_fate.total_usd`, both sides rounded to the cent exactly once at the
end — the identical rounding issue #536 already uses to reconcile
`cost_rows[]` against `total_cost_usd`. Rounding each bucket first and then
summing the six would be a different and wrong check: a `cost_rows[]` row is
one model's share of one transcript and routinely costs a fraction of a
cent, so six half-cent roundings accumulate into a mismatch over an account
whose rows are partitioned perfectly. The per-bucket `usd` the page renders
is rounded from those same unrounded sums afterwards, so a reader still sees
figures that add to within a cent of the total. A
`false` here is a bug in the fold, not a rounding note, and the panel says so
in words rather than rendering a silently-wrong table. Each bucket's own
`usd`/`n` and the decision it informs (the lever rule, D21) render together
in one row, `spend_fate.lever[<bucket>]` in the same cell as its own figures
— `delivered` is the reference baseline (not itself a lever), `rework`
points at D23's own class/cause accounting, `discarded` at item-selection
judgement, `overhead` at cycle cadence and back-pressure caps (the same
candidates `constraint` itself names), `defect_driven` at whatever crashed
or timed out the stage, and `unaccounted` says plainly that the item has not
resolved yet.

The **Turns per landed item** panel (D21/D14, `docs/ROADMAP.md`; issue #612)
is the companion figure to Token economics' own prompt-cache ratio for the
same "per stage and model" reading D21's own "Done when" line asks for. It
renders `turns_per_landed_item`, assembled by `lib/fleet-pricing.sh`'s
`fleet_pricing_turns_per_landed_item` over `item_lifecycle_fold`'s own
records — every landed item's own `stage-end` instants, `num_turns` and
`stage`/`model` read directly off them, never a second raw scan. Grouped by
`(stage, model)`, each row states `n` — the stage-ends sampled, not the
landed items behind them, since a landed item whose stage ran twice
contributes both of its stage-ends and each is its own turn count — plus
`mean_turns` and `median_turns` over exactly that sample. `n_landed_with_turns` — landed items carrying at least
one stage-end with a measured `num_turns` — is reported beside
`n_landed_total` rather than folded into it, so a landed item predating this
record (or whose stage-end predates `num_turns` being recorded at all) never
reads as a silent zero. The Co-Ordinator's own stage-end is not counted here
for the identical reason the actor/model scorecards above already exclude
its own engagement from their item-scoped joins: it typically carries no
`{repo, item}` of its own, since its stage spans selecting rather than one
item's work, so its turns cannot be attributed to one specific landed item
without a different join this figure does not build. The lever this
informs (D22): a model taking materially more turns than a peer for the
same stage on the same class of work is a prompt or tool-loop inefficiency
to fix at the model or prompt level, before the token spend it drives is
treated as a volume problem.

The **recent log** is the newest 80 events, one row each: time, the event as a
badge, **Node**, **Repo**, **Actor**, and the event's own detail. A
`disabled`/`enabled` event's badge additionally names its `scope` (issue
#426, implementation spec requirement 33) — `disabled · node` or
`disabled · fleet`, `enabled · node` or `enabled · fleet` — since the bare
event name cannot say whether a stop or a resume was one node's own or the
whole fleet's, and that is the first thing a reader scanning the tail asks.
A fleet-scoped one whose `fleet_flag` reads `"failed"` additionally appends
`fleet flag: failed` to the Detail cell: a local switch that changed while
the fleet flag did not follow it is exactly the case an operator must not
mistake for a clean transition. The Node, Repo and Actor columns are different
kinds of answer to "where did this happen" — which machine ran it, which
repository it was aimed at, which agent was acting — so each gets its own cell,
read positionally, carrying a dash when the event does not answer it: the Repo
cell is the repository whether or not the other two are known. The Node column
renders regardless of fleet size, unlike the
cycles table's own Node column — this one has always carried the node, single
node included, so nothing about it changes when the fleet has one node. It is
also, together with the cycles table, subject to the fleet strip's node
filter: clicking a node card restricts the recent log to that node's events
too, filtered before the 80-row cap so a node whose events have aged out of
the fleet-wide newest 80 still shows its own newest ones, with the section
heading and empty state following the cycles table's own wording ("Recent log
events — `<node>` only (click its card to clear)" and "No log events from
`<node>`."). The actor is derived rather than logged, because no event carries an
`actor` field and each pipeline already records it somewhere else: the
implementation pipeline's `stage`; `handoff` on `pr-ready`, naming which actor
took the pull request out of draft; `by` on `unblocked` and on `item-refined`
(and on those two events only — `by` elsewhere names a *person*, who set the
switch or cleared a stand-down); the Enabler's own `escalated`,
`enabler-examined`, `enabler-adjudication` (implementation spec requirement
36b's `adjudicate-first` pass) and `item-refined`, and the Refiner's
`refiner-examined`, which carry none of the first three. `item-refined` is the one event with two
writers — the Enabler's refinement pass and the Refiner — and only the
Refiner's carries `by`, so one without it is the Enabler's. A review-pipeline
event is the Project Reviewer's, which is a different actor from the cycle
Reviewer even where the review pipeline writes `stage: "reviewer"` — the same
distinction the Publisher's cost scan draws from the transcript path, drawn the
same way so the two halves of the page cannot disagree about who did what.
Steps with no agent in them name none: the clone (`stage: "workspace"`) and a
handoff the Script completed itself (`handoff: "script"`), as do the
cycle-level events (`cycle-start`, `selection`, `cycle-end`, and the review
pipeline's lifecycle), which are the Script's records of a cycle's progress
rather than any agent's work. Like the source tags and the by-actor chart, this
fails open: a token the page has never heard of renders as itself, so an actor
added upstream shows up unlabelled rather than vanishing into a dash.

Every pull-request number anywhere on the page is rendered by one widget,
which makes it a link with a **record card** carrying that PR's entry from
`github.pr_index`: repo and number, state, title, author, when it was opened
and merged or closed, the abbreviated merge commit (itself a link), its labels,
and — while it is still open — checks, review decision and mergeability. It
also names **the cycle that raised it**, joined client-side from the cycle
list, so the two halves of the page connect without the pipeline logging
anything new. A number with no entry yet says so rather than rendering an empty
card.

The card opens two ways, and they do not cross:

- a **peek** follows the pointer — hover on to open, hover off to close, with
  the pointer free to cross onto the card itself (it holds links of its own).
  Keyboard focus opens a peek the same way, and blur closes it; `Escape`
  closes either kind.
- a **pin** is an explicit act — a click or a tap — and only another explicit
  act closes it: the same number again, a click or tap anywhere off the card,
  the card's own close button (shown on pinned cards only), or `Escape`.
  Hovering off a pinned card leaves it open, and hovering another number does
  not move it; clicking another number does.

**A plain click opens the card rather than following the link**, because on a
touch device the tap that opens the card was also the tap that left the page,
which made the card unreadable exactly where the record is least visible
otherwise. The link is preserved for every input that asks for it: modifier and
middle clicks open the PR in a new tab, keyboard activation (`Enter`)
navigates as it always did — focus alone already shows the card — the `href` is
untouched so "copy link address" and the status bar still work, and the card
carries a *View on GitHub ↗* link of its own.

An open card is carried across the body's rebuild like the expanded rows and
open transcripts are, peeked or pinned as it was — matched to the exact
occurrence it was opened on, so it cannot reappear against one of the same
number's twins elsewhere on the page.

## Integration

- **End-of-cycle hook** — `agent-cycle.sh`'s cleanup runs the Publisher as
  `timeout 120 … >/dev/null 2>&1 || true`: failure-isolated and time-bounded,
  so it can never change the cycle's outcome, exit code, or timing. It is the
  only change to `agent-cycle.sh`. (Never edit `agent-cycle.sh` while a cycle
  is running — editing a running bash script shifts byte offsets and corrupts
  the live process. Use `agent-cycle.sh --disable '<why>'` before editing and
  `--enable` after: that is what the switch of requirement 2.3 is for, and it
  also stops the *next* cycle tick from starting mid-edit, which waiting for
  the lock to clear does not. `--status` reports both the switch and whether a
  cycle is still running, because disabling stops the next cycle, not the one
  already in flight.)
- **Heartbeat** — an optional `*/5 * * * *` crontab entry keeps in-flight
  state, the lock, and GitHub current between cycles. cron can't fire
  more than once a minute, so the entry runs `publish-dashboard-launcher.sh`
  rather than the Publisher directly: the launcher self-loops for ~295s
  (leaving a ~5s gap so consecutive cron runs don't overlap), republishing
  local state — lock, running cycle, cost, log — on every tick. A tick lands
  on a 5-second boundary, but the loop **measures what each tick costs and
  idles `LAUNCHER_DUTY_DIVISOR` (9) times that before the next one starts**, so
  the Publisher can take at most about a tenth of the window whatever a publish
  grows to cost. Pacing off a measurement rather than a constant is what keeps
  that true as the state grows: the loop previously slept to the next 5-second
  boundary and no further, on an assumption — stated in its own header and
  budgeted at five seconds — that nothing enforced and nothing measured. When a
  publish reached 20–22s the window ran rebuilds back to back, ~11 per window
  and roughly 78% of a core, producing a byte-identical page each time on an
  idle node, and the only way to find that was `top` on the host (#799). A
  cheap tick still lands on the next boundary, so an idle node's page is no
  less live than it was; an expensive one now pays for itself, and logs its
  cost and its backoff so the next such regression shows up in `dashboard.log`
  rather than only in `top`. A full GitHub-hitting publish runs only when the last fetch has
  aged past `LAUNCHER_GITHUB_MAX_AGE` (285s, so that the gap between fetches
  including the fetch's own ~20s comes to about five minutes); the cheaper
  `--no-github --fast` publish runs in between and carries the last fetch
  forward, so the page stays near-live without hammering the GitHub API. That
  GitHub tick is also the **full** build (see **The tiered publish**): the
  history roll-ups a fast tick carries forward are therefore never more than one
  fetch old, and the launcher needs no second cadence to decide when to rebuild
  them. The gate is the
  **age of `<state_dir>/.dashboard-github.json`**, which the Publisher stamps
  on every fetch it attempts — succeeded or failed — and which the launcher
  stamps itself if a publish dies before getting that far. Age, rather than a
  position in the window, is what makes the cadence self-healing: a missed
  cron window, a publish that overran its tick budget and a GitHub outage all
  reduce to "the next tick is the one that fetches", and none of them can turn
  into a retry storm. (It was a wall-clock test, `EPOCHSECONDS % 300 < 5`,
  until it was found never to fire: ticks always land on a multiple of 5, so
  the test meant `% 300 == 0`, and a window opened by a `*/5` entry starts on
  a 300s boundary and runs from offset +5 to +285. The GitHub panels refreshed
  only when cron's sub-second jitter happened to put the first tick on the
  boundary — half-hourly or worse, and invisibly, because a carried-forward
  fetch renders exactly like a fresh one. Hence both the age gate and the
  freshness reporting under **The Site**.) `flock` guards against a slow
  publish stacking up under the next tick. No tick starts inside the window's
  final ten seconds **or within the last measured cost of a tick of its own
  kind** — GitHub or local, whichever this tick is about to be, read from
  `<state_dir>/.dashboard-tick-cost` — so an oversized publish is not started
  just before the window closes and handed to the next cron fire as a lock
  collision. The reserve is the larger of the two, not their sum: ten seconds
  is its floor, so a tick costing less than that reserves exactly the tail it
  always did. It is tracked **per kind and persisted across windows** because
  the two kinds differ by more than a factor of two (42–47s against 17–20s on
  both laptop nodes) and because cron starts a fresh launcher every window,
  while the reserve is needed on a window's *first* tick — an in-process
  measurement would reset exactly when it is wanted. Reserving against
  whichever tick merely ran last was correct only while every tick was
  expensive: once the no-op path began firing the previous tick was almost
  always a sub-second skip, the reserve collapsed to the bare ten seconds, and
  a 45s GitHub tick starting in the last half-minute overran the window.
  supercronic runs no overlapping instance of a job, so it then dropped the
  entire next window — `not starting: job is still running` — and the page went
  ten minutes without an update (#807). A window always runs its **first**
  tick regardless, so a publish that outgrew its window degrades to one
  overrun per window rather than to a page that silently stops updating; a
  deferred tick logs `deferred: a <kind> tick needs Ns, window has Ns left`,
  because a fetch that does not happen is otherwise indistinguishable from a
  quiet system. `.dashboard-tick-cost` is launcher bookkeeping: it is excluded
  from the fingerprint under **The no-op tick** and from replication, so
  writing it cannot invalidate the skip it exists beside.
  The backoff computed from a tick's own cost (`last_cost_ms * duty_divisor`)
  is itself **clamped to what the window has left** (`endat - tick_margin`,
  floored at zero) before it is either slept against or logged (agent-ops#1305):
  a node livelocked by a parent memory cgroup's throttling (see `scripts/
  cgroup-parent-setup.sh` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement
  2n-i) measured a 4,511,835 ms tick, which the unclamped arithmetic turned into
  a `pacing:` line reading "next tick in 40606s" (11.3 hours) — harmless there
  only because the loop's own end-of-window check breaks out before sleeping
  that long, and a coincidence of that incident's numbers rather than a
  property the backoff itself ever had to respect. The `pacing:` line always
  reports the clamped figure, never the raw product, so the log cannot claim a
  backoff longer than the window it is inside of.
  A healthy window ends `exit 0` — its exit status is explicit, not
  whatever the final tick's lock bookkeeping happened to return
  (`LAUNCHER_WINDOW` shortens the window, `LAUNCHER_PUBLISH_CMD` swaps in a
  stub Publisher, and `LAUNCHER_DUTY_DIVISOR` sets the pacing ratio, for the
  test suite only — cron runs every default). Each window also opens by
  repairing `dashboard.log` and, alongside it, `state_dir`'s three other
  never-rotated logs — `log.jsonl`, `review-log.jsonl` and
  `revert-rate.jsonl` (agent-ops#794, `fleet_repair_log`, `lib/fleet.sh`): a
  container killed mid-append leaves the file's size recorded with the last
  writes' data blocks missing, and they read back as NULs. The lost lines are
  lost, but one NUL makes the whole file binary, and grep then stops printing
  matches for every intact line around it — GNU grep says "binary file
  matches", ugrep says nothing at all and exits 1. The repair clears them and
  appends a record of what went, so the loss stays on the record
  instead of being closed over silently — a plain-text line for
  `dashboard.log`, and, since a plain-text line appended to a JSONL file is
  exactly what every `fromjson? // empty` reader silently drops, a JSON line
  (`{"ts", "node", "event": "log-repaired", "dropped_nul_bytes",
  "dropped_lines"}`) for the other three. For a JSONL target the bytes alone
  are not enough: the run takes the newline separators inside it too, so
  deleting just the NULs splices the head of one record onto the whole of a
  later one and `jq -s` still refuses the file over the join — and a file whose
  own tail was in flight ends mid-record, which would make the appended repair
  record itself the unparseable line. So the run becomes the line break it
  destroyed, and each line either side survives only if it parses: the
  truncated stump goes and is counted in `dropped_lines`, the intact record the
  run ran into is recovered, and `jq -s` reads the whole file afterwards.
  `agent-cycle.sh` and `review-cycle.sh` apply the identical
  repair to their own per-cycle/per-review `.fleet-log.jsonl` union snapshot,
  immediately after building it and before anything reads it — a peer that
  has not deployed this repair yet, or history replicated before it did, can
  still hand a NUL-holed line to a node whose own logs are already clean.

## Components (as built)

- `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh` — the Publisher. `DASHBOARD_GH_CMD` names the
  `gh` it calls, and is exported so `scripts/gather-findings.sh` resolves the
  same one; it exists for the test suite, which must reach no network and
  cannot shadow a binary by PATH (the Publisher hardens PATH for cron, and its
  `gh` runs under `timeout`, which no exported shell function is visible to).
  Unset in production, where it is exactly `gh`.
- `lib/version.sh` — what code this node is running: the image's CI stamp
  (`build-info.json`) if there is one, else git `HEAD`, else nothing. Shared
  with `scripts/state-sync.sh`, which publishes the answer in every heartbeat.
- `lib/image-drift.sh` — whether that code is the registry's newest published
  commit (#155): `image_drift_status` reads `ghcr.io/pullwright/agent-ops
  :latest`'s `org.opencontainers.image.revision`/`.created` labels anonymously
  over the OCI Distribution API and compares against `lib/version.sh`'s
  answer. Backed by a cache file (`<state_dir>/.image-drift-cache.json`,
  `IMAGE_DRIFT_TTL` seconds, 240 default) that this script and
  `scripts/state-sync.sh` name identically, since unlike `lib/version.sh` and
  `lib/compose-drift.sh` a real network round trip sits behind it — one this
  Publisher's 5-second tick cannot pay on every run. `IMAGE_DRIFT_CURL_CMD`
  is the test seam, following `DASHBOARD_GH_CMD`.
- `scripts/doctor.sh --unattended` (agent-ops#543, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`
  requirement 2.6a) — not read live by this Publisher, unlike
  `lib/compose-drift.sh`/`lib/image-drift.sh` above: its GitHub section costs
  several calls per configured repository, too much for a 5-minute
  heartbeat, so it runs on its own hourly `crontab.tmpl` line instead and
  writes `<state_dir>/.doctor-status.json`
  (`{timestamp, verdict, fails[], warns[], skips}`). This Publisher reads
  that file verbatim into `status.doctor`; `null` until the first hourly
  pass has run. The raw file itself stays local — nothing replicates it to
  peers — but its own `verdict` now does, folded into the heartbeat's
  `doctor` field (agent-ops#1278) the same way `stage_health`'s does below,
  for `lib/pager.sh`'s `verdict-unanimous` invariant to read fleet-wide.
- `lib/stage-health.sh` (agent-ops#662,
  `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 2.8) — not read live by
  this Publisher either, on `doctor.sh --unattended`'s own precedent just
  above, even though (unlike doctor's GitHub section) recomputing it here
  would cost no network call: `agent-cycle.sh`'s own `cleanup()` already
  computes and merges `<state_dir>/.stage-health.json`
  (`{computed_at, threshold, idle_after_hours, stages}`) at the end of every
  cycle — and `monitor-cycle.sh` merges its own `monitor` stage into the same
  file at the end of every monitor run that engaged its stage — so reading it
  keeps this Publisher and the fleet heartbeat
  (`scripts/state-sync.sh`, below) reading the identical file rather than two
  computations that could disagree. This Publisher reads it verbatim into
  `status.stage_health`; `null` until this node's first cycle since this
  check shipped has completed. Unlike `.doctor-status.json`, its *content*
  does reach peers — folded into the heartbeat's own `stage_health` field,
  the same way `compose`/`image`/`switch` already travel — even though the
  raw file itself is excluded from `scripts/state-sync.sh`'s general
  replication, since a peer's copy of the raw file would answer for a
  computation nobody there ran.
- `lib/pager.sh` and `lib/pager-invariants.sh` (agent-ops#1278,
  `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 51) — unlike every
  component above, not a read: `pager_evaluate`, called from this
  Publisher's own `WITH_GITHUB` block, is the one place this script writes —
  a `pager-*` transition event to this node's own `log.jsonl`, and possibly a
  created or closed GitHub issue. `PAGER_GH`/`CLAIM_GH` are set to
  `DASHBOARD_GH_CMD` before the call, so the test suite's `gh` stub covers
  pager's own GitHub calls on the same terms as every other one this script
  makes.
- `scripts/publish-revert-rate.sh` (D18 issue #579,
  `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 2.6b) — not read live by
  this Publisher either, on the identical reasoning as `doctor.sh
  --unattended` above: it shells out to `scripts/mine-merge-history.sh`
  (several GitHub calls per bounded window per repository), too much for a
  5-minute heartbeat, so it runs on its own daily `crontab.tmpl` line and
  appends to `<state_dir>/revert-rate.jsonl` instead — fleet-wide data, unlike
  `.doctor-status.json`, so this Publisher reads it through the same union
  `fleet_logs` gives `log.jsonl`, not verbatim off this node's own file.
- `scripts/publish-dashboard-launcher.sh` — the sub-minute heartbeat driver
  (cron runs it every 5 min; it self-loops on 5-second boundaries).
- `dashboard/index.html` — the page (committed source; copied beside the
  generated `data.js` at publish time).
- `scripts/open-dashboard.sh` — regenerate + open in the browser.
- `scripts/serve-dashboard.sh` — optional loopback-only server (`file://`
  fallback). It writes no log of its own: whatever supervises it captures its
  output — a container runtime keeps it in the service's logs, and on the
  legacy WSL path the init script redirects it (below). **The page must answer
  on the host's loopback and on no network** — that is the requirement, and it
  is a requirement rather than an accident. Where the server runs on the host,
  loopback is where it binds, which is the default and what a bare invocation
  gets. The bind address is nonetheless a setting (`serve-dashboard.sh [port]
  [bind-address]`), because inside a container the literal bind and the
  guarantee come apart: a server on the container's own loopback is reachable
  from nothing at all, so each profile in `deploy/docker/compose.yaml` has to
  arrange the host's loopback its own way. The `tailnet` profile puts the server
  in the Tailscale sidecar's network namespace, unchanged on `127.0.0.1`, so
  Serve can proxy to its loopback (`ts-serve.json`, no Funnel). The `local`
  profile binds `0.0.0.0` inside the container and publishes
  `127.0.0.1:${DASHBOARD_PORT:-8787}:8787`, so the only route in is the host's
  loopback — the container's own addresses being on Docker's private bridge,
  which no one is on. Both land in the same place; neither widens what can
  reach the page. `deploy/agent-ops-dashboard.init` (the legacy WSL SysV path)
  sends the server's output to `<state_dir>/dashboard-server.log`, so every
  artefact the dashboard produces lands under `state_dir` and nothing is
  written beside the checkout. All of its settings (`RUNAS`, `RUNHOME`, `APPDIR`, `PORT`,
  `PIDFILE`, `LOGFILE`) are defaults overridable from
  `/etc/default/agent-ops-dashboard`, so the script carries no host-specific
  path that must be edited in place.
- The version stamp: `ARG`s and the `build-info.json` write at the foot of
  `deploy/docker/Dockerfile`, and the "Work out the version stamp" step of
  `.github/workflows/build-image.yml` that supplies them (with a check that the
  built image reads its own stamp back — the failure mode is otherwise silent).
- The cleanup hook in `agent-cycle.sh`; `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`
  entries for `dashboard/data.js`, `dashboard/stamp.js` and `build-info.json`;
  the README "Monitoring" section's "Dashboard" subsection.

## Verifying a change

- `./scripts/lint-shell.sh` clean — shellcheck over every shell script in the
  repository, not just this component's. `.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml`
  runs the same script on every pull request, so this is a gate rather than a
  good intention: it used to be neither, and four findings accumulated here
  unnoticed (pipeline spec, acceptance check 1g).
- `test/dashboard-exposure.test.sh` passes: the page is reachable on the host's
  loopback and on no network, in each of the ways the two compose profiles
  arrange that. `dashboard-local` publishes every port scoped to `127.0.0.1`
  (`DASHBOARD_PORT` moving the host side alone) and carries no `network_mode`,
  while its server binds `0.0.0.0` on the container port the mapping names —
  the two halves fail in opposite directions, one to a page on every interface
  and one to a page that answers nothing. The `tailnet` `dashboard` publishes
  no port, keeps the sidecar's namespace and takes the default bind, so Serve
  reaches it and nothing else does. The only other service that publishes
  anything is the node-health HTTP surface (`node-health`,
  `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 60d), guarded the same
  way and for the same two reasons — one loopback-scoped mapping, no
  `network_mode`, `0.0.0.0` inside the container — and every mapping either
  publisher declares is `127.0.0.1`-scoped. A bare `serve-dashboard.sh` still
  resolves to `127.0.0.1`.
- `test/version.test.sh` passes: a stamped image reports its build, an empty
  stamp (what a local `docker build` produces) falls through to git, a checkout
  reports `HEAD` and flags uncommitted work, neither source reports `null`
  rather than a half-filled guess, and the `(#N)` parser takes a squash-merge
  marker without taking a mid-subject issue reference for one. And none of the
  states that make a read fail — a repository with no commits, a clone with no
  `origin`, a stamp truncated mid-write — aborts a `set -e` caller, because
  `scripts/state-sync.sh` is one and a node that stops pushing is a node the
  fleet loses sight of.
- `test/publish-dashboard.test.sh` passes: the launcher exits 0 on a healthy
  (shortened) window and while another publish holds the lock; a cold window
  fetches from GitHub exactly once, a window following a fresh fetch not at
  all, and an aged stamp is refetched on the next tick; the batched cost scan
  matches the per-file semantics (day cut-off, torn-file tolerance, each row's
  own instant carried through as `ts` — `null` for a directory name that
  doesn't parse as one, which still counts toward the totals but drops out of
  `recent_costs` rather than guessing) and the
  whole publish stays within its process budget on a long history; a stage
  whose envelope parses but whose `result` is empty or whitespace-only still
  renders its cycle, with that stage's status `null`, while a stage whose
  envelope itself does not parse (a torn, mid-write file) still drops the
  whole cycle, exactly as before (TD26072802); and every
  node in a synthetic fleet answers for **itself** — a peer mid-cycle reports
  its own running stage, repo, source and item from its published log, a peer
  whose cycle ended reports idle and when, a node that has never run reports
  `live: null`, and our own row comes from the lock rather than the newest
  `cycle-start` (a tick that started, found the lock held and ended must not
  masquerade as what this node is doing). With the fleet's newest cycle
  unfinished, `status.last_cycle` skips past it to the newest that logged
  `cycle-end`, so the field the headers date it by is never null.
  The cost scan attributes each
  transcript to the actor that wrote it, names a review's as the Project
  Reviewer rather than a second cycle Reviewer, and leaves the actors summing
  to the total. The batched cost scan's per-model entries (issue #594, D21)
  each carry that model's own `tokens_input`/`tokens_output`/
  `tokens_cache_creation`/`tokens_cache_read`, summed from a canned envelope's
  `modelUsage` map the same way its `costUSD` already is, with a `modelUsage`
  entry that is not an object skipped exactly as the existing `costUSD`
  handling skips it; the `unknown`-model fallback carries all four as `null`,
  never `0`. `counts.stage_gaps` folds a synthetic event set of `stage-end`/
  `review-stage-end` records into its per-stage `runs`/`median_of_run_p50`/
  `worst_run_p95`/`worst_run_max`: a `stage-end` with `gaps: null` is excluded
  from `runs` rather than counted as a silent one, a `review-stage-end` (which
  carries no `.stage`) rolls up under the literal `project-reviewer` rather
  than colliding with the implementation pipeline's own `reviewer` stage, and
  `window_from`/`window_to` reflect the full synthetic set's own timestamps,
  not `COST_SCAN_DAYS`. Each node's version comes from its own heartbeat, and a peer
  publishing none reads as unknown rather than inheriting ours; the
  compose-drift and image-drift verdicts ride the same rule — a peer's from
  its heartbeat, a peer publishing none as null, never locally computed, and
  our own row answering for itself. And the
  pull-request index — driven through `DASHBOARD_GH_CMD`, so a GitHub tick
  costs no API call — resolves every reference the page holds including the
  version a node runs (which no open-PR query names), reads each pull request
  at most once, re-reads none of them on the following tick, carries forward
  across a `--no-github` tick, and bounds a cold fill to a few references
  rather than one burst. Two hand-appended `cycle: "manual"` records a
  fortnight apart raise no row in Recent cycles, take none of the `MAX_CYCLES`
  budget, and leave the real cycle at the top — while both events stay in the
  log tail. With more no-op ticks in the log than `MAX_CYCLES` — newer than
  the real work, as the `*/15` cadence produces — no stand-down or lock-held
  skip shape raises a row, the substantive cycles still fill the detail list,
  and `noop_ticks` counts every one of them, split by kind, carrying the
  newest tick's timestamp; a stand-down that also logged a `claim-lost`
  (issue #245's raced shape) keeps its row and stays out of the count, and so
  does one whose `cycle-end` never came. A union carrying events that belong
  to no cycle — one stamped `cycle: null`, as `publish-revert-rate.sh` writes
  them, and one with no `cycle` field at all — leaves the window whole: the
  real cycle renders with its stages and its own events, `cycle_render.ok` is
  true, and both cycle-less events stay in the log tail. Conversely, a detail
  render that cannot run at all still publishes the rest of the page, but says
  so on stderr and sets `cycle_render.ok` false with `jq`'s reason attached,
  rather than serving the empty `cycles[]` as though the fleet had been idle.
  And with `cron.log` short and a
  `cron.log.1` beside it —
  `scripts/rotate-logs.sh` having just rotated — the cron panel's tail draws
  from both, oldest first, rather than going blank for the tick after a
  rotation. A cycle that lost a claim to a peer's contention (`claim-lost`,
  cause `held`) before a `selection` that names `race_losses` is marked
  `raced: true` carrying that same count, whichever `outcome` it then reached;
  one that lost every candidate carries `standdown_cause` — `"raced"` for
  contention, `"unreachable"` when every loss was a GitHub outage instead,
  `"pre-claimed"` when nothing was ever attempted because the cycle's own
  gather had already seen every candidate claimed (implementation spec 17a's
  `claim-skipped`), and `"untraceable"` when every candidate failed the
  refinement-traceability check and the repair could not rescue one, or the
  Script's own compose step could not build a work order at all
  (implementation spec 17f/17h) — and
  only a cycle with a `held` loss is marked `raced` at
  all: a GitHub outage names no peer to contend with, and a pre-claimed
  skip was never contention in the first place, so neither shape may wear
  contention's badge (implementation spec 17a, issue #245). The same is true
  of the selection-integrity cause: a work order the Script refused to
  hand on names no peer either.
  An item that is blocked *and* void reaches `void[]` and not
  `blocked[]` (implementation spec 34h, acceptance check 8g), while an ordinary
  block beside it is still listed — a subtraction that over-reached would empty
  the panel that says the pipeline is stuck, which looks exactly like a pipeline
  that is not. Each of the five GitHub sources (TD-PPagop-26080201) is
  exercised both ways against a stubbed `gh`: healthy, each of the four
  state-carrying sources reads `answered`, while a healthy `pr list` leaves
  `github.ok` true; with one source's call failing (a rate limit), that
  source alone reads `failed` (or, for `pr list`, is named in `github.error`
  directly) and `github.ok` turns false — while an unrelated repo's own
  healthy call for the same source still reads `answered` in the same tick,
  proving the failure is told apart per-repo rather than flipping the state
  for every repo at once.
  The actor-scorecards aggregate (issue #610, D22) is asserted from two
  synthetic logs. The first drives the Co-Ordinator's own `measure` — the
  folded issue #319 corroboration rate — through the same five shapes its
  predecessor's test did: a verdict rejected then recovered by the retry that
  followed it (and whose picked item later lands, proving the `picks_landed`
  join), an accepted one over a non-empty eligible set (denominator only), one
  written before implementation spec 3v recorded `corroboration` events, an
  empty eligible set (neither term), and a verdict rejected twice that the
  Script then had to pick for (whose picked item never lands). A cycle counts
  its verdict **once** — spec 3v writes both a `corroboration` and a
  `none-selected` for the same answer, and counting both would inflate every
  denominator by exactly the cycles that stood down cleanly — and two models
  in the same window carry separate rates and separate `picks_landed` counts;
  a `selection` is attributed to the Co-Ordinator model and never to the
  Implementer `model` the event itself carries; and the picks-landed rate is
  gated on `picks_status` over its own two picks rather than riding on the
  corroboration rate's sample, so a rate the page must not state cannot reach
  it through the other population. The second log drives the
  outcome join across the other four actors: an Implementer item killed once
  (a deduped `stage-rerun` rework record attributed to it) then landed on a
  clean rerun — `landed_with_rework`, not `landed_unchanged`, and cost/
  wall-clock summed across *both* attempts, not just the one that landed it —
  beside a second, trivial-tier item landed unchanged on a different model,
  proving the two tiers stratify into separate rows; a Reviewer earning both a
  `human-change-request` and a `post-merge-revert` on one item and a
  `post-merge-revert` alone on a second — three escape records over two
  reviewed items reading as **two** escaped items, so the count is of items
  rather than records, and the second item, whose only record is keyed by its
  pull request's own number, counts at all only because `pr_url` re-keys it
  onto the work item; an Enabler's `enabler-adjudicate` and `enabler-decide` stage-ends
  sharing the critical tier though each names a different item, one landed and
  one voided, with cost-per-landed reading only the landed one's own spend,
  plus a third item met by *both* of those stages that is examined **once**,
  not once per stage name feeding the row — the count the row-level item dedup
  exists for, and the one whose absence would halve cost-per-landed;
  and a Refiner's two `item-refined` events, one bounced back
  (`refinement-bounce-back`) and one landed, read from the refined-item count
  rather than from the Refiner's own (itemless) stage-end. A log with no
  stage-end for any of the five actors still ships the card as a real object,
  `rows: []` on each of the five, rather than omitting the key.

- `test/dashboard-render.test.sh` passes its plain-`grep` check, run without
  `node` and independent of the harness below, that the header's documentation
  nav carries all six `blob/main/<path>` links (README, the three pipeline
  specs, the metering schema, the roadmap) verbatim in `dashboard/index.html`.
- `test/dashboard-render.test.sh` passes: `dashboard/index.html`'s own inline
  script, run unmodified under `node` against checked-in `DASHBOARD_DATA`
  fixtures and a DOM stub that only builds trees (`createElement`/
  `createTextNode`/`appendChild`, plus a serialiser — no layout, styling or
  event dispatch), renders the cells the fixtures name. This is what catches a
  page that renders the *wrong* thing rather than merely throwing: a cycle
  live in the Co-Ordinator stage with nothing selected yet reads "In
  progress", never the finished-cycle "Ended"; a cycle with no `cycle-end` and
  no node claiming it reads "No clean end" with fleet data and "Not ended"
  without any; a `needs-refinement` blocked row carries its badge and is
  removed by the hide filter; and the log tail's Node, Repo and Actor columns
  answer all three positionally — an actor read from `stage`, from `by`
  and from `handoff`, the review pipeline's named as the Project Reviewer, the
  clone step and the cycle-level events naming none, and a missing node
  keeping its own cell rather than letting the repository slide into it. A
  `disabled`/`enabled` event's badge is asserted to carry its `scope` (issue
  #426) — `disabled · node`, `enabled · fleet` — and a fleet-scoped one whose
  `fleet_flag` is `"failed"` to append `fleet flag: failed` to its Detail cell.
  A cycle fixture carrying `raced: true` renders the `↻ raced` badge beside its
  outcome badge, and no other cycle in that fixture renders it — the marker
  answers "how did this cycle get its outcome", not a second outcome of its
  own (issue #245); it also renders the "recovered race ×N" badge naming the
  count, while a separate fixture of a cycle that lost *every* candidate
  (`raced: true`, `standdown_cause: "raced"`, outcome `stand-down`) carries
  the `↻ raced` marker and never that one, having recovered nothing; and a
  third, of a cycle that skipped every candidate as pre-claimed
  (`raced: false`, `standdown_cause: "pre-claimed"`), renders as an ordinary
  stood-down row wearing neither race badge — a selection defect contends
  with nobody. Both race badges further require more than one active peer
  (issue #829): a fixture whose `fleet.nodes` names exactly one node carrying
  `role: "active"` renders neither `↻ raced` nor "recovered race ×N" for a
  recovered cycle or a lost-every-candidate one, even though both still carry
  `raced: true`/`race_losses` — while a fixture naming two active nodes
  renders both badges exactly as the fleet-less fixtures above do. A
  fixture whose `noop_ticks` counts more filtered ticks than the forty slots
  hold (issue #271) renders its substantive cycles as ordinary rows plus the
  one summary line — the total, the stood-down/lock-held-skip split and the
  newest tick's age — while a fixture with a zero aggregate (and one with no
  `noop_ticks` key at all, a `data.js` from before the field existed) renders
  no such line. A fixture carrying `noop_ticks.overlap` (11a, agent-ops#1287)
  alongside a non-zero `total` renders a second line naming the overrun
  count, and a fixture carrying `overlap` with `total` at `0` still renders
  that second line on its own — the old total-gated skip must not swallow it,
  since a fleet whose every cycle does real work can still lose firings to
  one running long. The
  per-repo `nice` badge is asserted from two fixtures, because both of its
  silences are load-bearing and neither is visible on the page that has them:
  a repo at `-5` carries a blue badge naming `×3.17` and earlier attention, one
  at `3` a grey badge naming `×0.5` and later, both disclaiming starvation,
  under a note naming the Script rather than the Co-Ordinator; a repo with no
  key beside them carries nothing; and a config whose repos are all `0` or
  keyless renders no badge and no note anywhere on the page. A node behind an
  image published longer ago than `image_behind_grace_hours` carries an
  **image behind** badge naming the registry commit, while one whose registry
  check failed carries **image unverified** instead (#155). A node carrying a
  node-scoped disable (`switch.disabled`) shows a **disabled** badge beside
  its role badge, naming the reason and the expiry, while its own enabled
  self carries no such badge (#379). Two further fixtures separate that from
  the local record a fleet-wide `--disable` leaves on the node that issued it
  (`switch.scope: "fleet"`, implementation spec 2.3): with the fleet flag set,
  the page raises the fleet banner alone — no second banner for the mirror and
  no **disabled** badge on the issuing node, while a peer's genuine
  `--this-node` disable beside it still badges; with the flag cleared, the
  surviving mirror raises this node's own banner and badge, both naming it as
  a leftover of a fleet-wide disable since cleared rather than as a
  node-scoped decision. The merge-autonomy kill switch (D18 issue #576,
  `fleet.flags.merge_autonomy_kill`) is asserted from three further fixtures:
  a `state: "disabled"`, `record.kind: "manual"` one raises its own banner
  naming the reason, who set it and the `--restore-merge-autonomy` command
  that clears it, while never claiming every node stands down (the fleet
  switch's own wording) or badging any node disabled; a `record.kind:
  "fail-closed"` one still raises the banner but explains the state repo
  could not be confirmed clear rather than naming an operator, and omits the
  clear command a cause no command fixes has no business offering; and a
  fixture carrying no `merge_autonomy_kill` flag at all — every `data.js`
  from before this field existed — raises no such banner. A cycle whose
  `selection` carried `race_losses` (implementation spec 17d, #248) shows a
  blue **recovered race ×N** badge beside its title in the cycle history —
  informational, not a warning, since losing a claim race and then winning a
  later one is the claims (17a) working as designed — while a cycle with no
  `race_losses` at all shows none. A source marked
  `failed` in `github.inputs[<slug>].state` (TD-PPagop-26080201) renders a
  "couldn't read" marker in place of its count, and a fixture carrying no
  `state` field at all — every repo's data from before this field existed —
  renders exactly as it always did. The spend-today card's persisted
  GMT/local/24h choice (#186) is asserted by seeding the harness's
  `localStorage` stub rather than
  simulating the click: with no stored choice the card reads "today (GMT)"
  against `spend_today_usd`, and a stored `24h` relabels it "last 24h" and
  sums only the `recent_costs` rows within a rolling 24 hours; a stored
  `local` is asserted for its label only, since which rows fall on the
  reader's own calendar date depends on the moment the suite runs. The void
  list's two caps are asserted from a twelve-row fixture whose
  two oldest rows sit *first* in the data, because the cap is only meaningful
  once the list is sorted: the heading counts twelve, the ten newest render
  (the tenth-newest last), neither old row appears until asked for, the
  see-more control names how many are held back, and every row carries both
  the height cap and the class that makes it open. A fixture inside the cap
  renders no control at all.
  The actor and model scorecards (issue #610, D22) are asserted from
  `actor-scorecards.json`, which carries a populated row for every shape the
  card renders: all five actors' cards appear, in D12 order, each headed and
  each table's columns named; a Co-Ordinator row whose own base outcome
  columns read "insufficient evidence" (it never joins to one item) beside a
  `measure` that clears its own sample and states a real corroboration rate
  and picks-landed ratio, and a second Co-Ordinator row below the minimum
  sample on both of that measure's two independent gates — rendering
  "insufficient evidence" in place of each rate rather than stating a
  picks-landed percentage off two picks; an Implementer row split `unchanged`/`w/ rework` with its
  own cost-per-landed and wall-clock-per-landed figures, and a second,
  trivial-tier row rendered `insufficient evidence` below the minimum sample;
  a Reviewer row whose own `measure` reads as an escape rate, not a
  corroboration rate; an Enabler row naming the `critical` tier and an
  unblock-success measure; and a Refiner row whose measure counts bounce-backs
  against items refined. A `finished.json`-shaped fixture predating the
  aggregate entirely renders the "written by a Publisher that did not record
  it yet" empty state rather than a clean-looking empty card set it has no
  data for.
  The cost section's blocks (issue #330) render inside one `.costgrid`
  container in reading order — by-day, by-model, by-actor, then both cost
  notes — at the same depth as the charts rather than as paragraphs beside the
  section. Document order is what is asserted because it is what the layout
  rests on: a multi-column flow fills each column top-to-bottom in document
  order, so the order of the appends *is* the order a reader sees, whichever
  column each block lands in. Out of scope by the same tree-building limit:
  the pull-request hover card's pointer/focus behaviour, and which column the
  browser balances each cost block into — that is layout, and layout is what
  this stub does not do; it is covered by the manual check below.
  A fixture with no `status.stage_health` renders "No cycle has completed
  on this node" in the Stage health section and raises no banner (agent-ops
  #662); one carrying a `failing` stage raises the red banner naming it,
  lists that row with its own consecutive-failure count and failure detail
  alongside an `ok` and an `idle` row rendered distinctly, and badges the
  same node's own fleet-strip card with its failing-stage count —
  independent of that card's running/idle state, which is the property this
  check exists for: a node whose cycles are completing normally while a
  stage keeps failing must not read as plain "running" or "idle".
- The back-pressure card agrees with the gate it depicts, in both directions,
  from two fixtures of its own. `backpressure-claims.json` (issue #427) holds
  a changes-requested PR, a draft, an approved PR waiting on a human, one
  unraised item claim and one `pr-<n>` exclusion entry: the gauge reads 3 of
  3 and trips red, counting the claim the open-PR listing cannot show it and
  not the exclusion entry, whose PR is in that listing already.
  `backpressure-claim-scope.json` (the over-correction in PR #434) holds seven
  registry rows against two PRs: the gauge reads 4 of 8 and does not trip,
  having dropped the `enabler` and `refiner` pseudo-slug tombstones, the
  `pr-<n>` entry, and the item claim on the draft already counted — while
  keeping the item claim on the *approved* PR, which sits in the human's queue
  outside the sum and so is the only record of that work in flight. Both
  assert the `title` tooltip verbatim, because it is the composition
  `agent-cycle.sh` logs and the two are meant to be readable against each
  other. The live-claims panel below is asserted to still show the
  pseudo-slug rows in full: the gauge's narrowing is a statement about the
  cap, not about what an operator hunting a stuck item may see.
  `backpressure-otherwise-eligible.json` (D18 WI-6, issue #946) holds a
  repository configured at `agent-merges-routine` with three ready PRs — an
  approved `complexity:high`, an approved `complexity:low`, and a
  `CHANGES_REQUESTED` `complexity:high`: the gauge reads 2 of 3, counting the
  latter two toward the cap and putting only the approved `complexity:high`
  one in the human-waiting figure — confirming both halves of the rule at
  once, that the level-aware exclusion is narrowed to an otherwise-eligible
  pull request rather than every ready one, and that the narrowing itself
  never reaches a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` pull request, which the pipeline owes a
  change at every level.
- The **Token economics** and **Stall profile** panels (issue #594, D21) are
  each asserted from their own fixture. `token-economics.json` holds three
  stage/model rows over `cost_rows[]`'s new `tokens_*` fields — one with a
  healthy sample and a high cache-read share (reads its ratio and "no action
  indicated"), one with a healthy sample and a low share (names the lever:
  the prompt prefix may be varying, consider stabilising it), and one below
  `TOKEN_MIN_SAMPLE` (reads "insufficient evidence" instead of a rate) — plus
  an `unknown`-model row carrying `tokens_*: null` on every field, asserted
  absent from both the by-stage and by-model breakdowns entirely rather than
  folded in as zero. `token-economics-dedup.json` (issue #1591) holds one
  model shared by two actors within one cycle and by three actors across two
  more, asserting the by-model row counts all five as distinct transcripts —
  clearing `TOKEN_MIN_SAMPLE` where a `cycle`-only dedup would have left it
  short — while the by-stage rows for those same actors are unaffected.
  `stall-profile.json` holds `counts.stage_gaps` rows
  exercising all five of that panel's own Decision branches: a stage whose
  `worst_run_max` is at `STALL_NEAR_BACKSTOP_RATIO` of its known backstop
  (names the lever and the direction — raise it), one comfortably inside it
  ("no action indicated"), one below the minimum sample and below that ratio
  ("insufficient evidence"), one below the minimum sample but *at or above*
  that ratio (still names the lever and the direction — the near-backstop
  read does not wait on a sample, since `worst_run_max` is exact at any size),
  and one this page holds no backstop for at all ("no cap on record for this
  stage"); the panel's own caption is asserted to state its window separately
  from the cost charts' and to label its across-run figures as such rather
  than as pooled percentiles.
- `test/dashboard-refresh.test.sh` drives the SPA refresh tick itself (issue
  #1288), under a second, narrower stub (`test/dashboard-refresh-harness.js`)
  that fires the page's own `#refreshbtn` click listener — the one external
  hook onto `tick()` — against a scripted, synchronous sequence of simulated
  `stamp.js`/`data.js` fetch outcomes; unlike `test/dashboard-render.test.sh`
  it asserts nothing about the DOM, only which files get fetched. A page load
  seeded with `data.js`'s own embedded fingerprint disagreeing from
  `stamp.js`'s (the two-request race a publish landing between the page's
  initial `<script src>` pair can produce) still fetches `data.js` on the
  first tick rather than reading the disagreement as "unchanged". A `data.js`
  fetch that fails leaves the tab's own comparison fingerprint unmoved, so
  the very next tick — polled with the *same* fingerprint the failed fetch
  never got to apply — retries rather than skipping; only a fetch that
  actually lands may advance it, confirmed by a further tick then correctly
  reading that fingerprint as unchanged.
- `test/rework-panel.test.sh` drives `lib/rework-panel.sh`'s own fold
  directly, on `test/item-lifecycle.test.sh`'s own precedent: the three
  questions computed correctly over one hand-traceable fixture (tokens'/
  elapsed time's rework share against first-pass yield's literal
  zero-attributed definition, `whose`'s attributed/not-attributed split, the
  escape ladder's population/caught/escaped/escape_rate at each rung, and
  the two distinct reasons a `cost_to_catch_at_next` reads `null` — terminal
  rung versus genuinely unmeasurable, and a third: a catch whose own cycle
  this log meters nothing for, dropped from the average rather than counted
  as a zero-cost sample); dedup, including that two genuinely
  distinct `post-merge-revert` corrections on the same item (different
  `evidence.by`) both count, that two nodes logging the same repetition
  count once toward `rework_count` and `whose`, and that the copy kept is
  the first by `ts` — visible in `cost_to_catch_at_next`'s own average,
  which reads that same deduped stream, so only the surviving copy's cycle
  is charged there rather than every node's echo of it; `how_much`'s own
  token/elapsed/cost share deliberately reads the stream *before* that
  reduction instead, so both nodes' cycles count as rework spend for the
  one deduped repetition (the fixture asserts the full 1000 of the fleet's
  1000 tokens here, never the 100-of-1000 undercount dropping the echoing
  node's cycle would produce); the Reviewer-waving-work-through signature
  demonstrated against a constructed before/after fixture (a rising
  `escape_rate` at the `agent-review` rung alongside a *falling* `caught`
  count at that same row); and the degradations (a malformed line, a missing
  log) that yield a conforming report rather than aborting the fold.
  `test/dashboard-render.test.sh`'s own `rework.json`/`rework-outage.json`
  fixtures then check only that `D.rework` renders as the panel's own three
  sections and its three static caveats (the share's cycle granularity,
  rework never being a target of zero, and the human-gate coverage gap), and
  that an unassembled payload (every field `null`) reads as an outage rather
  than a quiet zero-rework tick — the fold's own correctness is
  `rework-panel.test.sh`'s job, not this one's.
- `test/fleet-sizing.test.sh` and `test/fleet-pricing.test.sh`
  (`docs/ROADMAP.md` D21/D14, issue #612) drive `lib/fleet-sizing.sh`'s and
  `lib/fleet-pricing.sh`'s own folds directly, on `test/constraint.test.sh`'s
  own precedent: `fleet-sizing.test.sh` demonstrates the acceptance
  criterion itself — a constructed fixture carrying one over-provisioned
  node (high idle-without-demand share, high share of the fleet-wide
  contended-claim-loss pool, no exclusive landings) and one healthy node,
  asserting the fold names the first as a shrink candidate and the second as
  healthy — plus the three insufficient-evidence gates (no time-account
  data, a window below the minimum sample, fewer than two nodes) and that a
  node with real exclusive delivery is never recommended for removal
  regardless of how idle or contended it otherwise reads;
  `fleet-pricing.test.sh` demonstrates every row of the fate-mapping
  priority order landing in its own bucket on one constructed
  `cost_rows[]` (including that a row already claimed by rework outranks
  its own landed terminal fate), that the six buckets reconcile to
  `total_usd` to the cent, and the turns-per-landed-item mean/median over a
  constructed set of landed and open items. `test/dashboard-render.test.sh`'s
  own `fleet-sizing.json`/`fleet-sizing-outage.json` and
  `fleet-pricing.json`/`fleet-pricing-outage.json` fixtures then check only
  that `D.fleet_sizing`, `D.spend_fate` and `D.turns_per_landed_item` render
  as their own panels — the shrink candidate and the healthy node on the same
  table, every fate bucket's own lever in the same cell as its figures, the
  by-stage/model turns table — and that an unassembled payload on any of the
  three reads as an outage rather than a quiet zero, the same discipline the
  constraint and rework fixtures just above already exercise.
- `claim-expired-tombstone.json` (agent-ops#839) holds one claim backdated to
  `do_expire()`'s sentinel `1970-01-01T00:00:01Z` alongside one with a real,
  recent `ts`: the live-claims panel's Held column reads the first "expired —
  pending cleanup" and never a fabricated day-count, while the second still
  renders its ordinary relative age.
- On a node that has been up for at least ten minutes,
  `grep 'github: refreshing' <state_dir>/dashboard.log | tail -3` shows one
  line roughly every five minutes, and `github.fetched_at` in `data.js` is
  within about five minutes of `generated_at`. Those two facts are the whole
  of "the PR panels are live"; nothing else on the page distinguishes a
  refresh that is happening from one that is not. (If that `grep` comes back
  empty or says "binary file matches", check for a hole before concluding the
  heartbeat is dead — `tr -d '\0' < dashboard.log | wc -c` against the file's
  size. The launcher repairs one at the top of each window, so this should
  only ever be true of a log written by a node that has not yet rolled.)
- `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh` against the real `state_dir` produces valid
  JSON (`data.js` minus the wrapper passes `jq empty`), and `grep` finds no
  `/home/…` path or token in the output.
- Open the page and confirm the panels populate: a failed cycle appears under
  Failures, and its transcript + stderr open inline. On a fleet, each node's
  card names what that node is doing and the header counts how many are working;
  on a single node the header carries the detail itself and there is no strip.
- On that same page, the cost section reads down the left column and on down
  the right, with no column running conspicuously past the other and the cost
  notes last (issue #330). This one is checked by eye in a browser, in both
  colour schemes and on either side of the 760px breakpoint, because the split
  is decided by the browser from the rendered heights: nothing that runs
  without layout can see it, and the DOM-stub harness above deliberately
  asserts only the document order the split is taken over.
- With a `blocked` row whose `kind` is `needs-refinement` in `data.js`, the
  Blocked items table shows a **refinement** badge next to that row's item id,
  the heading names how many refinement blocks there are, and its "hide N
  refinement blocks" checkbox — shown only when at least one exists — removes
  those rows from the table (and the heading's count) when checked, restoring
  them when unchecked. An ordinary blocked row (`kind` unset or `""`) carries
  no badge and is unaffected by the filter. `test/dashboard-render.test.sh`
  asserts the badge, the count and the checkbox's label from a fixture; the
  checkbox's own click behaviour is outside its tree-building DOM stub, so
  stays a manual check here.
- With more than ten `void` rows in `data.js`, the Void items table shows the
  ten newest, `See more — N older items` at its foot reveals the rest and turns
  into `See fewer`, and a row whose reason runs past three lines is clipped with
  an ellipsis and opens to the whole of it when clicked (clicking again closes
  it). Leave a row open and use the control: the re-render that follows must
  keep both that row open and the list expanded — the same survives-a-rebuild
  rule the cycle rows and open transcripts follow. Like the refinement filter,
  the assertions cover what renders and the clicking is manual here.
- While a cycle is in flight, its row in Recent cycles reads **in progress**
  from the moment it starts — including during the Co-Ordinator stage, before
  any `selection` is logged, which is the whole window in which the log-derived
  ladder has nothing to say — and no finished row's badge changes. Check the
  first minute of a cycle specifically: that is where reading the ladder alone
  produces "Ended". `test/dashboard-render.test.sh` asserts this from a fixture
  in that exact window; this manual check is for confirming it against a real
  running pipeline too.
- A pull-request number behaves the same way under a pointer, a finger and a
  keyboard. Hover one and the card opens; move off and it closes. Click it and
  the card opens **and stays**, the page does not go to GitHub, moving the
  pointer away does not close it, and hovering another number does not move it;
  click the same number again, click off the card, use its close button or
  press `Escape` and it closes — while a click *inside* the card does not.
  Ctrl/cmd-click still opens the PR in a new tab, and `Enter` on a focused
  number still navigates. On a phone (or a touch-emulating browser) a tap opens
  the card rather than GitHub, the card fits the viewport, and its close button
  and *View on GitHub ↗* link are both reachable. Leave a card open across a
  refresh or two: it is still there, and still pinned if it was pinned — a
  rebuild destroys the focused anchor, so this is where a stray `focusout` can
  close the card the reanchor just reopened.
- The page has zero console/page errors (it renders headlessly under a browser
  with no thrown errors).

## Design decisions

- **Single generated data file + committed page**, rather than a server or a
  build: the cheapest thing that works, openable as a `file://` with nothing
  running, and trivial to regenerate.
- **Local/private, no GitHub Pages or Action.** An earlier draft proposed a
  scheduled Action publishing to a companion repo; it was dropped as needless
  cost and exposure. The machine is authenticated and the repos are public, so
  the local Publisher fetches all GitHub data itself; a localhost page can't be
  viewed while the machine sleeps anyway, which was the Action's only draw.
- **Remote access is tailnet-scoped, never public.** The README's "View it
  away from home" section layers `tailscale serve` in front of the untouched
  loopback server (`deploy/tailscaled.init` runs the daemon on this
  systemd-less WSL distro): the server still binds `127.0.0.1`, Tailscale
  authenticates each viewing device against the owner's own tailnet, and
  traffic is end-to-end WireGuard. This loses nothing while the machine
  sleeps — the pipeline only produces telemetry while awake. Public exposure
  (`tailscale funnel`, Pages, shareable tunnel URLs) stays rejected for the
  reasons above.
- **The page fetches nothing external.** All GitHub reads happen in the
  Publisher via `gh`; the page reads only its local `data.js`. Offline-capable,
  dependency-free, no CORS or rate-limit concerns.
- **Redaction is unconditional** even though the data is local, so a
  screenshot or copied file is safe and a future private repo can't leak.
- **Limit detection is independent of the log**, because the pipeline's logger
  misses weekly-limit phrasing — the dashboard reads the transcripts directly.
- **A skipped GitHub fetch is not a failed one.** Once the heartbeat runs every
  few seconds, most ticks publish with `--no-github` to spare the API, and a
  full fetch happens only once per window. If a `--no-github` tick simply wrote
  `github.ok = false` with empty `prs`/`inputs`, the dashboard would blank the
  PR list and work sources — and raise the "GitHub unavailable" banner — 59
  ticks out of 60, turning a deliberate skip into a standing false alarm. So a
  skip carries the **last real fetch forward** (cached beside the state, marked
  `stale`) and never touches `ok`. `ok` therefore means one thing only: the
  most recent *attempted* fetch and whether it succeeded. `ok === false` — the
  banner's trigger — now fires only for a fetch that ran and failed; a skip is
  `ok` unchanged, and a never-yet-fetched page is `ok: null`, neither of which
  is an alarm. The staleness is not hidden: `stale`/`fetched_at` say how old the
  GitHub half is, distinct from the whole page's `generated_at`.
- **Carrying a fetch forward silently is what let a broken cadence hide, so
  the two ages are now both on the page.** The decision above is right, and it
  has a cost: a fetch that is never taken is indistinguishable, on screen,
  from one taken a moment ago. When the launcher's gate turned out never to
  fire under cron (see **Heartbeat**), the page went on reporting "data 3s
  ago" over PR data half an hour old, and every panel rendered perfectly. Two
  things follow, and both are load-bearing rather than decorative. The header
  shows `data <age> · GitHub <age>`, and past 12 minutes the second turns
  amber and raises its own banner — a reader can now see which half of the
  page is old. And the cadence has a test (`test/publish-dashboard.test.sh`,
  driven through `LAUNCHER_PUBLISH_CMD` so it costs no API call) asserting
  that a cold window fetches exactly once, a warm one not at all, and an aged
  stamp is refetched on the next tick. A behaviour whose failure mode is
  *looking healthy* cannot be left to a careful reading of the script.
- **The GitHub tick's gate is a duration, not a point in the schedule.** The
  rule "fetch when the last fetch is older than N" holds whenever the tick
  runs; the rule "fetch on the tick that lands at second zero" holds only if
  such a tick exists, which is a property of cron's alignment, the loop's
  bounds and how long a publish took — three things that are decided
  elsewhere and that no test here was watching. The first rule also degrades
  the way this page wants: on a missed window it fetches late rather than not
  at all, and on a GitHub outage it retries at the cadence rather than at the
  tick rate, because the stamp records the *attempt*.
- **The blocked and void lists are not computed here.** `blocked[]` and
  `void[]` come from the same shared implementation the Script feeds its
  Co-Ordinator (`lib/cycle-state.sh`, per requirement 34a of
  `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`) — `open_blocked_items` and
  `void_items`; only the projection for display is local. The dashboard originally had its own near-copy of the
  rule, and the two silently disagreed — which matters more here than
  anywhere else, because this page is where someone looks to find out why the
  pipeline is repeating itself. A monitor that reimplements the thing it
  monitors will agree with it right up until the moment that would have been
  useful. Anything else the page reports that the pipeline also computes
  belongs under the same rule: share the definition, don't mirror it.
- **A cycle's source is a column, not a detail.** Which source the
  Co-Ordinator drew an item from is not a fact about that one cycle so much as
  a fact about the pipeline: read down the column and you see the mix it is
  actually working — all security this week, or nothing but tech-debt for two
  days. That reading only exists if every row shows it at once, which a
  per-row expand forecloses. The detail row still repeats it verbatim
  alongside the rest of the record; the duplication is deliberate.
- **An outcome is something a cycle has to finish to have.** The Publisher
  classifies a cycle by reading its events against a ladder — `pr-ready`, then
  `pr-raised`, `attempt-failed`, `none-selected`, `stand-down`,
  `cycle-skipped`, `selection` — and that ladder answers the question "how did
  this go?" for a cycle that is over. Asked of one still working it answers
  anyway, in the past tense, and its floor is the worst available reading: a
  cycle whose Co-Ordinator is still choosing has logged nothing on the ladder
  at all, so a job three minutes old rendered as **Ended** for the whole
  length of its first stage. So the column now consults `ended_at` first — the
  `cycle-end` timestamp, which is the only thing in the record that says the
  cycle is over — and reports a state until there is an outcome to report.
  Which state needs one fact the log cannot supply: a `cycle-start` with no
  end looks identical whether the cycle is running or the node died holding
  it, so the row asks the fleet whether any node claims that cycle as its live
  one, exactly as the node cards do, and says **no clean end** when none does.
  That last one is an accusation, so it is withheld where the data cannot
  support it: `data.js` written before the fleet strip existed carries no node
  list at all — which is what a page reloaded from an updated checkout reads
  until the Publisher next runs — and there the row says only **not ended**.
  Nothing is lost by dropping the mid-flight rungs: how far a running cycle
  has got is what the Item, Stages and PR cells beside it already show, and
  they show it without asserting that it stopped there.

  `status.last_cycle` is the same mistake one field over, and is fixed the same
  way: it means "the last cycle the fleet ran, and how it went", both readers
  take a finished cycle for granted — the headers date it by `ended_at`, the
  node cards badge it by `outcome` — and it was nonetheless filled with the
  newest cycle-start, finished or not. So an unfinished newest cycle dated the
  fleet's last activity with a null, which `fmtAgo` renders as an em-dash:
  "last cycle — ago". It now selects the newest cycle carrying an `ended_at`,
  and is null when none has, which the headers already render as no last-cycle
  clause at all. The general rule both cases are instances of: **a field whose
  readers assume a finished cycle must select for one**, because every cycle
  list on this page is newest-first and the newest is exactly the one most
  likely to still be running.
- **A record in the log is not the same thing as a cycle, and the cycle list
  now says so.** The Publisher built one row per distinct `cycle` value in the
  log union, which quietly assumed every record came from a run. Some do not:
  the pipelines' own documented escape hatch for a stuck item is a hand-written
  `unvoided` (README, "Unsticking an item"), and it carries the
  `cycle: "manual"` sentinel. Every such record, from every node, for all time,
  therefore collapsed into a single phantom row — and each of the row's cells
  then failed in the direction that looks most like a real problem. With no
  `cycle-start` the Started column falls back to the first event's timestamp,
  so the row was dated to the earliest hand-edit anyone had ever made and
  froze there; with no `cycle-end` and no node claiming it, the Outcome column
  reached for the accusation above and read **no clean end**, permanently, of
  something that was never running; with no `cycles/manual` directory the
  Stages cell showed three empty stages, as though the work had been abandoned
  before it began. And because the fleet ordering is a reverse *lexical* sort
  of the id — the one sort that interleaves every node's history correctly,
  since a real id begins with its UTC timestamp — `manual` outranked every
  digit and pinned itself above every genuine cycle, holding one of the
  `MAX_CYCLES` slots for good.
  The fix is to filter on the id's shape where the list is built, rather than
  to special-case the string `manual` or to re-sort by `started_at`: the sort
  is not what is wrong, and a filter on the shape covers the next sentinel
  anyone invents as well as this one. Doing it in the Publisher rather than the
  page keeps the events themselves in the log tail, which is where a record
  about the pipeline belongs, and leaves untouched every reader that acts on
  them — the limit stand-down, the blocked and void sets — because each keys on
  the event and the item, never on the cycle.
- **An empty panel states its own cause (the 2026-08-29 blackout).** For ten
  days every dashboard in the fleet reported "No substantive cycles in the
  fleet window" while all four nodes worked normally. Three things had to line
  up. `scripts/publish-revert-rate.sh` began emitting `rework` rows with
  `cycle: null` (#941); the detail render grouped the union by `.cycle`
  without filtering those out, which is a fatal `jq` error rather than a null
  row, and it renders the whole window in one program, so the error cost every
  cycle at once; and that `jq`'s stderr went to `/dev/null` behind a guard
  whose only action was to leave the cache alone, after which the publish
  reported a successful write. The cache then drained to empty as the window
  slid over cycles that were never rendered, and the page — which had no way
  to distinguish an empty list from an idle fleet — supplied a plausible
  explanation for it.
  The filter is the defect fix and is deliberately the same one the file's
  three other `group_by(.cycle)` readers already applied; it was written four
  times and omitted once. But a filter only closes this instance. What made
  the instance cost ten days was that the failure had no way to be seen, so
  the render now reports its verdict twice — to the Publisher's log for
  whoever is reading logs, and in the payload as `cycle_render` for whoever is
  reading the page, which in practice is everyone. The rejected alternative
  was to make the render failure fatal to the publish: it is not, because
  every other panel on the page is still correct, and a page that stops
  updating entirely is a worse answer than a page with one panel that says
  what is wrong with it. Nor is the cache sweep skipped on a failed render —
  it prunes to the window, which is right whatever the render did; it was the
  render's silence, not the sweep's correctness, that turned a fault into a
  blackout.
- **A no-op tick is counted, not listed (issue #271).** `MAX_CYCLES = 40` was
  sized for an hourly cadence; the `*/15` change (#268) quadrupled the tick
  rate without touching it, and most of the new ticks are no-ops — a
  stand-down short-circuit or a lock-held skip, three events and no stage.
  Filling the fleet's forty detail slots with those cut the window from
  roughly half a day of history to two-to-four hours, most of it rows
  carrying nothing. The two candidate fixes were to raise `MAX_CYCLES`,
  which grows `data.js` — the very thing the fleet-wide cap protects — or to
  stop no-op ticks consuming slots; the second was chosen, with the filtered
  ticks surfaced as the `noop_ticks` aggregate rather than dropped, so the
  cadence itself stays visible (a fleet whose ticks stop aggregating has a
  scheduler problem this line would otherwise hide). The aggregate is O(1)
  by construction — three counts and one timestamp, never a second list —
  and the filter matches the exact three-event shapes rather than every
  `stand-down`/`skipped` outcome, so a stand-down that carries more than
  the shape (a raced one, #245) keeps its detail row and its badges. What
  this costs: a *fresh* stand-down no longer has a row of its own, and its
  reason text is a log-tail read rather than a click — the aggregate's
  newest-tick timestamp and the standing banners (switch, usage-limit) are
  what keep that reading a glance.
  Losing a claim to a peer's healthy contention and then claiming the next
  candidate is not a different outcome from an ordinary first-try
  selection — the cycle still did whatever `outcome` already says, PR raised
  or otherwise — so `raced` is not folded into the outcome ladder as a new
  rung. It is a fact about *how* the cycle got there, rendered as its own
  small badge beside the outcome badge (`↻ raced`, titled with the loss count
  and whether the race was recovered or the cycle stood down over it), the
  same layering the in-flight badge below already uses for "still working"
  beside a floor reading it does not want to overwrite. A `standdown_cause`
  of `"raced"` on a stood-down cycle gets the identical badge, for the same
  reason "Stood down" alone does not say whether the fleet's own contention or
  a GitHub outage caused it — reading the reason text is not a substitute a
  glance at the column can make. A `standdown_cause` of `"pre-claimed"`
  deliberately gets no badge: no peer raced this cycle for anything — its
  Co-Ordinator proposed work the gather had already seen claimed — and the
  row's reason text names that defect; its `claim-skipped` events are also
  what keep the row out of the `noop_ticks` aggregate, so the shape stays
  visible in the history rather than being counted away. Blue, like the "recovered race ×N" badge
  beside the item and for implementation spec 17d's reason: contention is the
  fleet working, and amber on this page is reserved for what wants acting on.
  The two badges do not say the same thing twice, either: `race_losses` is a
  count of this cycle's own `claim-lost` events, so a cycle that lost every
  candidate carries one without ever having claimed anything, and "recovered
  race" is withheld from it — an outcome of `stand-down` is exactly the case
  the word "recovered" would be false of.
  Both badges further require more than one currently *active* node (issue
  #829): `claim-lost`'s cause `held` means some claim already existed when
  this cycle tried to take it, but only an active node ever attempts one
  (`role_current`, `lib/role.sh`) — a standby fetches its peers and serves
  its own dashboard but runs no cycles, so it can never be the peer a claim
  was lost to. With `fleet.nodes` present and at most one node carrying
  `role: "active"`, no peer could have contended for anything, so `↻ raced`
  and "recovered race ×N" render nothing for that cycle even though its
  `raced`/`race_losses` fields are unchanged — the row still reads its plain
  outcome, "Stood down" or otherwise, exactly as if the fields were absent.
  Fleet-less data (no `fleet` key at all) says nothing about how many nodes
  are active, so it is not read as "one" and renders as it always has, and
  fleet data naming two or more active nodes renders both badges exactly as
  before this distinction existed.
- **An overrun-slot count is not a no-op tick, and must not share its gate**
  (implementation spec 11a, agent-ops#1287). `noop_ticks.overlap` counts
  `cycle-skipped {reason: "overlap"}` events — schedule slots supercronic
  silently dropped because the cycle logging them was still running its own
  stages — and that cycle keeps its ordinary row in `cycles[]` regardless: it
  is the opposite of the stand-down/lock-held pair above, which are logged by
  a tick that did nothing at all. Reusing the existing summary line's
  `!agg.total` gate would have hidden the overrun count on any fleet whose
  every cycle does real work — exactly the fleet an operator most needs to
  see it on, since a lightly-loaded fleet with idle-tick no-ops to spare is
  the one least likely to overrun in the first place. The line renders on its
  own condition, `agg.overlap` alone, alongside rather than folded into the
  no-op summary's own sentence, since these firings were never held out of
  the list the way a no-op tick's own are.
- **Distinct classes of data are distinguished by shape, not colour alone.**
  Source tags are outlined and square; outcome badges are filled pills. Both
  are colour-coded, and the two sit side by side, so without the shape
  difference "Failed" and `security` would read as the same kind of label in
  the same red. Colour then carries identity *within* a class, shape carries
  the class itself — which is also the only reason eight source colours are
  legible at all: eight hues is past what hue alone reliably separates,
  especially for a colour-blind reader. Any future class of badge on this page
  should take a third shape rather than a ninth hue. The in-flight badge takes
  the rule the same way: it stays a filled pill, because it sits in the outcome
  column and belongs to that class, and carries the page's existing live/idle
  dot inside it — the same mark the header and the node cards use for the same
  meaning — so "still working" is legible without colour and without inventing
  a shape for a thing that is not a new class of data.
- **The source label/colour map is display-only, and fails open.** The
  vocabulary itself belongs to the Co-Ordinator (`prompts/coordinator.md`'s
  `sources` list) — the page cannot share that definition the way it shares
  the blocked/void rule above, because `data.js` carries only whatever token
  the pipeline already emitted. So the map styles tokens; it never decides
  them. An unrecognised source renders in grey with its raw token, never
  dropped and never silently blank: a source added upstream then shows up
  unstyled, which is a prompt to add a colour, rather than invisibly missing
  from the mix — the one thing the column exists to show.
- **A `nice` badge has to name the Script, because the panel it sits in names
  the Co-Ordinator.** The page's one per-repo surface is headed "Work sources
  (what the Co-Ordinator sees)", and a `nice` is the one ordering input the
  Co-Ordinator is deliberately never given: the Script computes the walk order
  and hands over the finished list, and the values themselves never reach the
  model (pipeline spec, requirement 3). A badge dropped in unqualified would
  therefore make the page assert the opposite of the design, on the surface an
  operator reads precisely when asking why a repo keeps coming up first — and
  the next place that reading sends them is the Co-Ordinator's prompt, where
  there is nothing to find. Hence the note above the panel rather than the
  tooltip alone: a tooltip is invisible to a glance, absent under a finger, and
  this is the half of the answer that decides where someone looks next.
- **A neutral `nice` renders nothing, not a zero.** A repo at `0` and a repo
  with no `nice` key are the same repo, and a fleet that has set none is the
  ordinary case, so neither draws a badge and the note stays off the page
  entirely — a config with no `nice` anywhere renders byte-for-byte the page it
  rendered before the feature existed. This is the same omit-never-empty
  contract `lib/repo-order.sh` keeps for the no-op fingerprint, kept here for
  the matching reason: a neutral config should be indistinguishable from one
  predating the feature, on the page as in the hash. A `nice 0` badge would
  also be the wrong kind of information — three repos each wearing one says
  the weighting is a thing being *used*, when what it means is that nobody has
  touched it.
- **Plan limits are not on this page, because they are not obtainable
  (checked 2026-07-17).** The obvious feature request — show used vs remaining
  credits for the current session and the weekly limit, in the header — was
  investigated and dropped as not buildable, and this note exists so it is
  investigated once rather than every time someone notices the gap. For an
  individual Pro/Max subscriber there is no supported source: no `claude usage`
  subcommand exists; `--output-format json` carries no quota field (see "State
  it reads"); `/usage` is interactive-only; and the Admin/Usage API is
  documented as *"unavailable for individual accounts"* — it needs an
  organisation on Console API billing. The numbers do appear to be cached in
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, and that is the temptation to resist: it is
  undocumented internal structure inside a secrets file, so it can change shape
  without notice, and Claude Code itself serves those bars from a cache up to
  an hour stale. A stale limit bar is worse than no limit bar, because it is
  the one number an operator would act on — and it would sit next to a
  freshness clock implying it was current. If a supported read ever ships, the
  header centre is where it goes.
- **Cost is labelled as an estimate, not as spend.** The cards and charts say
  "Est. token cost" rather than "Spend", with a note saying what the figure is.
  They previously said "Spend today", which on subscription auth quietly
  asserts two false things: that the money was charged, and that the dashboard
  is tracking a budget. Someone reading a spend figure next to a pipeline that
  can hit a usage limit will reasonably join those two facts up, and conclude
  the dollars are what runs out. They are not related: the limit is denominated
  in tokens and time, and no arithmetic on this page converts one into the
  other. The figure is worth showing — it is a good proxy for how hard the
  pipeline is working, and it is the only per-cycle cost signal there is — but
  it has to be named for what it measures. A second `p.costnote` underneath
  states the currency (USD) outright (issue #438): every dollar figure on the
  page — cards, charts, the estimate note above it — is the same fixed
  currency regardless of the Claude account's own billing region, and that
  isn't obvious from a bare `$` sign to a reader whose local currency also
  uses one.
- **Cost is cut by actor as well as by model and by day, because the actor is
  the only one of the three anybody chooses.** The day is a fact about when the
  cron fired; the model is nearly a restatement of the actor, since
  `config.json` pins one model per role. What an operator can actually decide is
  which agent does what — whether the Reviewer needs Opus on complex work,
  whether the Enabler is earning its cycles, what a repository review really
  costs against an implementation cycle. None of that is legible from the
  other two charts, and all of it was already on disk: the actor is the
  transcript's own filename, so this cut needed no new field, no new log event
  and no extra API call.
- **The cost charts balance into columns instead of a fixed grid (issue
  #330).** A `.two`/`.stack` split — by-day alone on the left, by-model and
  by-actor stacked on the right — left a gap under the right column on any
  day that by-day's sixty rows ran noticeably longer than the other two
  combined, because the split was pinned at build time to a guess about
  relative height rather than measured against it. `column-count: 2` with
  `break-inside: avoid` on each block instead lets the browser's own balance
  algorithm decide the split from the rendered heights on every load: the
  blocks — day, model, actor, then both cost notes — stay in that reading
  order and simply land wherever the shorter side is, no JS layout code and
  no new data needed.

  What this buys is a split that is right for the data in front of it rather
  than for the data the layout was written against, plus the note's own
  height reclaimed from a gap it used to sit below. It does not flatten the
  section: while by-day holds sixty rows and the other blocks hold five rows
  or fewer each, no arrangement of them fills a column that one of them sets
  the height of, so the right column still ends well short of the left.
  Closing that would mean letting by-day itself break across both columns,
  which buys the space at the price of a chart whose heading stands over half
  of it.
- **"Today" defaulted to GMT with no way to say so, until #186.** The card's
  figure was always `spend_today_usd`, computed against `date -u`, and nothing
  on the page told a reader in another zone that "today" wasn't theirs. Fixing
  that needed two things the Publisher alone can't decide: which reading the
  reader wants, and which calendar day a given cost fell on *for them*. Neither
  is knowable server-side — a dashboard has no fixed reader, let alone a fixed
  zone — so `recent_costs` ships raw `{ts, cost}` rows (three days back, ample
  padding either side of any real zone or of a `last 24h` window) and the
  arithmetic for "local" and "24h" runs client-side, against `new Date()`. The
  chosen mode is `localStorage`, not a query param or a server-side setting: a
  dashboard has no accounts and no URL a reader necessarily bookmarks, and a
  choice that reset on every visit would answer #186 no better than not asking
  at all. `spend_today_usd` itself is untouched — GMT stays the default and the
  cheap path when a reader never touches the toggle.

  Adding it exposed that the roll-ups were **not totals**. The scan read
  `cycles/` and not `reviews/`, so the Project Reviewer — the most
  expensive actor per run — contributed nothing to spend-today, spend-total,
  by-day or by-model. That is a worse fault than a missing chart: the numbers
  were not per-pipeline, they were simply short, and nothing on the page said
  so. Both directories are now scanned. The figures step up on review weeks;
  they were wrong before, not inflated now.
- **A pull-request number is rendered by one widget everywhere, and it carries
  its record.** `#89` on its own says almost nothing, and the click that would
  explain it costs a context switch — enough friction that nobody spends it
  while scanning, which is what this page is for. So every number on the page
  goes through one renderer that attaches a record card: repo, title, state,
  author, opened/merged times, the merge commit, labels, and — while it is open
  — checks, review decision and mergeability. It is deliberately generic rather
  than special-cased per panel, and the newest use is the one that proves the
  point: on a fleet card the number *is* the version statement, so the record
  behind it is the whole of what makes the card readable.

  Two things keep it honest. The card names **the cycle that raised the PR**,
  joined client-side out of the cycle list rather than recorded anywhere — the
  pipeline already logs `pr_url` per cycle, so the join cannot fall out of step
  with the table three panels down, and it costs nothing. And a number with no
  entry yet says exactly that, rather than rendering an empty card: an index
  miss is the ordinary state of a PR raised since the last fetch, not an error.

  **The card is a peek on hover and a pin on click, and a click does not follow
  the link.** Hover was the whole interaction to begin with, and on a phone
  there is no hover: the tap that opened the card was the same tap that left
  for GitHub, so the card flashed and the page was gone. That is the reader who
  needs it most — a phone is where the dashboard gets checked away from a desk,
  and where opening GitHub to answer "did that land?" costs the most. So a
  plain click now opens the card and pins it, and the *View on GitHub ↗* link
  the card already carried is the way through.

  The two modes are kept strictly apart, because mixing them is what makes this
  pattern annoying elsewhere: a card opened by hovering closes by unhovering,
  and a card opened by clicking closes only by clicking — off it, on the number
  again, on its close button, or `Escape`. A pinned card therefore neither
  evaporates when the pointer drifts nor chases the pointer onto the next
  number along, which matters because reading one is a deliberate stop. The
  close button exists for the pinned case alone: dismissing by "tap the blank
  page behind it" is not an affordance anyone can see, and the number that
  opened the card is under the reader's own thumb.

  Navigation is not lost, only unbound from the plain click. Modifier and
  middle clicks still open the PR, the `href` stays on the anchor so the status
  bar and "copy link address" tell the truth, and `Enter` still navigates —
  keyboard focus already opens a peek without spending the activation, and the
  card is not in the tab order behind the link, so pinning it from the keyboard
  would strand a reader in front of links they could not reach.

  The index is affordable because a **merged or closed pull request is
  immutable** — cached permanently by ref, so a warm tick spends nothing however
  many numbers are on screen — and because the cold fill is bounded to a few
  references a tick, since forty `gh pr view` calls at `GH_TIMEOUT` each would
  not fit in the heartbeat's window. Its reference set is gathered from the page
  itself, which is also what stops the cache growing: it holds what is on
  screen, and needs no expiry rule of its own.
- **A node's version is a pull-request number, and the image has to be told
  it.** "Which version is this container running?" had no answer anywhere. A
  fleet is *routinely* mid-update — `watchtower-pre-update.sh` defers a roll
  while a cycle is in flight — so nodes differing is normal, and the question
  that matters ("has the fix reached the node that needed it?") could only be
  answered by exec'ing into containers. The answer is now on the card.

  It is a pull-request number rather than a SHA because a SHA names the bytes
  and a pull request names the change: `#89` has a title, a diff, a review and a
  merge time behind it, and the widget above puts all of that one hover or one
  click away.
  The commit is shown too, abbreviated and linked, for anyone reconciling
  against `docker image inspect`. And the image cannot work either out for
  itself — `.dockerignore` keeps `.git` out, correctly, because the image is a
  deployment and not a working tree — so CI stamps `build-info.json` at build
  time and `lib/version.sh` falls back to git for a checkout. A peer's version
  travels in its heartbeat, since a peer publishes no container; a peer that
  publishes none reads as *unknown* rather than inheriting ours, on the same
  rule as every other derived peer fact.

  The `behind` marker is grey, not amber. Being behind is the expected state
  during a roll, and colouring an ordinary condition as a warning teaches an
  operator to ignore the colour. What it is there to catch is a node that stays
  behind — a watchtower that has stopped rolling — which shows up as the marker
  failing to clear, and which nothing else on this page would reveal.

  Beneath the version sits the node's *deployment file*, which the image
  cannot answer for: a node holds its own `compose.yaml`, no roll can update
  it, and a merged compose change sat inert on every node twice before
  anything said so (#131). The card renders the heartbeat's compose-drift
  verdict (implementation spec 2.5, `lib/compose-drift.sh`) as a badge —
  **compose drifted** when the node's copy differs materially from the copy
  its image shipped, **compose unverified** when the file is not mounted into
  the containers at all, which itself means the file predates the check and
  is behind. Both are amber where `behind` is grey, deliberately: `behind`
  resolves itself on the next idle poll, while a drifted compose resolves
  only when something acts on it, and an amber that never clears by itself is
  exactly the alarm that was missing. `in-sync` renders nothing, and so does
  an absent verdict — a peer on an image from before the check, or an install
  that is no container — because for an image the roll already on its way
  will start answering, and a node whose rolls have stopped is the version
  line's `behind` failing to clear, already caught above.

  Beside those badges, on the same line, is what that node's own reconciler
  did about the drift: the heartbeat's `compose_reconcile` verdict
  (implementation spec 2.5a, `lib/compose-reconcile.sh` — the actor the drift
  badge had no counterpart for until the `reconciler` service existed). It
  renders on the same discipline as everything else here, which leaves only
  one of its four states visible. **reconcile refused** is amber: the node
  will not apply the merged file — its project directory is not configured,
  or the new file needs a `${VAR}` this node's `.env` does not define — and
  nothing will change until a human acts, which is the one state that stays
  put. **reconcile deferred** is grey, `behind`'s colour and `behind`'s
  reasoning: a cycle is in flight, or a recreate failed, and the next tick a
  few minutes away retries it. `reconciled` and `in-sync` render nothing,
  because a `reconciled` verdict has already cleared the drift badge beside
  it. Each badge's title carries the recorded reason verbatim. An absent
  verdict also renders nothing, and that is the common case rather than an
  edge one: a node whose owner has not run the one enabling `up -d` has no
  reconciler, and its card reads exactly as every card did before this
  existed — the drift badge, and the per-node ritual in its title. The
  verdict is the node's own and is never derived here for a peer, on the
  same rule the compose verdict above follows: only that node's container
  holds that node's project directory and its Docker socket.
- **The `behind` version marker cannot tell a uniformly stale fleet from a
  healthy one, so a second badge compares against the registry instead
  (#155).** `behind` (above) compares nodes with each other —
  `fleetNewestVersion()` — which is exactly what reads as agreement when
  every node adopts the same broken image at once, as happened across
  #149/#154: four nodes, four identical commits, four green cards. The image
  badge (`lib/image-drift.sh`, via the heartbeat) instead compares each
  node's own commit against `ghcr.io/pullwright/agent-ops:latest`'s own
  `org.opencontainers.image.revision` label — read anonymously over the
  registry's API, never `origin/main`, since a documentation-only merge
  publishes no image at all and would otherwise read as false staleness (see
  "The node stack" in the implementation-pipeline spec).

  **image behind** is grey while the registry's newest image is younger than
  `image_behind_grace_hours` (`config.json`, surfaced in `config`) — the same
  colour and the same reasoning as the version line's own `behind`, since the
  same explanation applies. Past the grace it turns amber, `compose`'s
  colour: by then the ordinary deferred-roll explanation has had time to
  resolve itself, and a node still behind may have a watchtower that has
  stopped rolling altogether. **image unverified** is its own grey badge
  rather than silence — unlike compose's absent-verdict case, nothing else
  on the page would otherwise say the registry check was even attempted,
  whether because it failed outright or (routinely, right after this code
  first rolls out) a peer's heartbeat predates it. `current` renders
  nothing, the same rule every other in-sync verdict on this page follows.

  The registry query is a real network round trip, unlike every other field
  on this card, so it is not repeated on the dashboard's 5-second tick:
  `<state_dir>/.image-drift-cache.json` (excluded from state-sync
  replication, like the other local caches) holds the last answer, and
  `scripts/state-sync.sh`'s own heartbeat push shares the same file, so
  whichever of the two next crosses `IMAGE_DRIFT_TTL` pays the one query.
- **Neither `behind` nor `image behind` can catch an update mechanism that
  has stopped working altogether, ahead of and independent of the drift it
  eventually causes (#603).** On 2026-08-14 watchtower tried to create two
  replacement containers it had never stopped, hit a name collision, and
  logged `Session done Failed=2` on every poll thereafter while the node
  stayed on the previous image — through a fleet roll the other three nodes
  had already taken. Every badge above still read healthy, because none of
  them read the update mechanism's own verdict, only the staleness it
  eventually causes. The card renders the heartbeat's updater verdict
  (implementation spec 2.5, `lib/updater-health.sh`) as a third badge below
  compose and image: **updater deferring**, grey, naming how long
  `deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh` has been holding this container's
  roll back for a cycle or review in flight — it resolves the moment that
  ends, the same colour and reasoning as `behind`, and only while that defer
  streak stays inside `updater_defer_stuck_after_seconds`. **updater stuck**,
  amber, `compose`'s colour for a fault only a human clears, in either of two
  shapes the badge's title distinguishes (`u.reason`): the hook allowed a
  roll — on every poll since the time named, watchtower asking again each
  time — and the container it allowed is still the one running — same
  hostname, so watchtower never actually replaced it — and the retry that
  follows repeats the very operation that collided, so it will not clear on
  its own; or the defer streak above has itself outlasted
  `updater_defer_stuck_after_seconds`, past which no lock the hook honours
  could still be legitimately held, so "an implementation cycle or review is
  in flight" is no longer a true reading. Both shapes hold only while
  watchtower is still asking: `updater_status` reads liveness first
  (implementation spec 2.5, agent-ops#1071), and a hostname whose own newest
  ledger entry has itself gone older than `updater_stuck_after_minutes`
  renders no badge at all rather than a permanent **updater stuck** — the
  node's watchtower has stopped polling this container altogether (taken
  down deliberately, or the container itself retired), which is a different
  fact from either amber shape above and not one this badge asserts.
  `rolled` (the ordinary case), an absent verdict — a peer whose heartbeat
  predates the check, or one still inside the short window before its own
  first poll — and any other status this page does not recognise (a future
  release, or a truncated/corrupt heartbeat field) all render nothing, the
  same absent-means-unknown rule `compose` and `image` already follow: an
  unrecognised status is routed explicitly to "render nothing" rather than
  folded into `deferring`'s benign badge, the same way `image`'s own
  `unverified` branch is routed explicitly rather than folded into
  `current`'s silence.
- **A crash-loop run the Script has classified `transient` renders as a
  fourth badge, below updater, rather than as an escalation issue (issue
  #1073).** `lib/crash-loop.sh`'s `crash_loop_verdict` groups consecutive
  Co-Ordinator failures by their identical `detail` for requirement 2.7's
  escalation ladder; what it could not previously say is whether the API was
  refusing a request outright (deterministic, will not clear by retrying) or
  simply unreachable (a 5xx, a dropped connection — external, and self-
  clearing). On 2026-08-29/30 the Ockham host lost outbound network for four
  hours, every failure recorded a 503 verbatim, and the only signal of it was
  a crash-loop escalation asserting "almost certainly deterministic … no
  amount of retrying will clear it" — false on the escalation's own evidence,
  and gone the moment the network returned. A run whose `escalate` field
  reads `false` — every failure it counted classified `transient` — now never
  reaches that escalation at all; the Publisher reads the same union log
  directly (`fleet_logs`, not the heartbeat: this is a fleet-wide fact, not
  one only the affected node can report on its own behalf) and renders
  **provider unreachable**, amber like `updater stuck` — a fault worth a
  human's attention, but not one this node's own code caused — on every
  node the run's own `nodes` names, titled with the consecutive count, the
  repository the run belongs to where it has one, the
  verbatim detail, and how long the run has been going. It renders nothing
  the moment no such run is currently active (the newest verdict's
  `escalate` reads `true`, or no run has reached `crash_loop_after` at all)
  — there is no separate "cleared" state to track, since the union log is
  read fresh every publish and a Co-Ordinator success for that same
  repository, anywhere in the fleet, ends the run the same way it already
  ends the escalating case. `crash_loop_verdict` counts per repository
  (agent-ops#1630) and so can name more than one transient run at once; the
  Publisher keeps only the first, since this field holds a single verdict —
  a narrowing agent-ops#1624 tracks rather than one this badge hides, so an
  absent badge is not evidence that no other repository is in the same
  state.
- **A fifth badge reads the host-facts record a node's own collector
  writes (`scripts/collect-host-facts.sh`, agent-ops#1283,
  `docs/HOST-FACTS-SCHEMA.md`), a fact source none of the four badges
  above can reach: each of them reads what runs *inside* the scheduler
  container, and the D24 fence puts this container on the far side of its
  own host's real network path, so nothing above can tell a host's own
  egress MTU, a container's own OOM-kill count, or a Kubernetes rollout's
  own stall from in here.** The Publisher folds `state_dir/host-facts/
  <node>.json` (self) and `<peers_dir>/<peer>/host-facts/<peer>.json`
  (each peer) into that node's row as `host`, `null` when no record
  exists for that node yet — the collector's own schedule, not this
  page's 5-second tick, so a freshly rolled node reads `null` here for a
  while exactly as it does for `compose`/`image` above. The card renders
  one amber badge, **host degraded**, naming the worst of three facts it
  checks for, in this order: an MTU mismatch between `DOCKER_MTU` and the
  host's own measured egress MTU (`host.network.mtu_match`) — the same
  fact `doctor.sh`'s Egress section now reads from the identical file,
  here because a card is checked far more often than `doctor.sh` runs;
  any container this node runs having been OOM-killed at least once
  (`containers[].memory.oom_kill_count`); or a Kubernetes Deployment stuck
  below its desired replica count past its own progress deadline
  (`rollouts[].stalled`).
  Everything else the record carries — per-container memory/cpu figures,
  a per-container image digest mismatch, the updater ledger tail — stays
  out of this badge deliberately: it is either routine, or already
  covered by `image`/`updater` above, and is one click away in the raw
  record for anyone who needs it. This node's own viewer-vantage self-probe
  (`viewer_probe.<this node>`, agent-ops#1286's own check) is excluded too,
  for a different reason than routine: the collector ships with no route to
  a peer's tailnet (#1339), so every compose node's self-probe fails from
  its first tick regardless of health, and folding it into this badge would
  light every card permanently rather than flag a real fault. The probe
  still runs and its result is in the record for anyone reading it
  directly; it rejoins this badge once #1339 gives it a route to succeed on
  a healthy node. No badge (and no line at all) when the record is absent
  or carries none of the three facts above.
- **A sixth badge, `resource budget`, compares this node's own measured
  CPU/memory/bandwidth/disk against `config.json`'s `resources` budgets
  (requirement 55, D14, agent-ops#606)** — the dashboard's half of the same
  comparison `doctor.sh`'s own "Resource budgets" section makes, over the
  identical `resource_budget_report` derivation (`lib/resource-usage.sh`).
  The rule is stated twice, not shared: `doctor.sh` calls
  `resource_budget_breaches`, and this page — JavaScript in a browser, with
  no route to a bash library — re-states it in `resourcesLine`, so keeping
  the two in step across an edit is a maintenance obligation, pinned by
  `resource_budget_breaches`'s own boundary test. The row's
  `resources` field (self: recomputed live from this node's own
  `.resource-samples.jsonl`; a peer: carried in its heartbeat, `null` when
  the peer predates this feature or has not run its collector yet) is the
  windowed `{latest, median/growth, p95}` report per container/volume;
  `D.config.resources` is this run's own resolved (schema-defaulted)
  budgets. Amber, titled with every breach found — each named as
  `<container>'s <resource> (p95 <actual> > budget <budget>)`, or for a
  volume, `<volume>'s disk usage (<actual> > budget <budget>), growing
  <n> bytes/day` when the report has a growth figure — on the same "badges
  only for an exceptional condition" discipline `host degraded` above
  already holds: a container or volume within budget contributes nothing,
  so the badge itself, not just its absence, is the signal. Growth rate is
  named ahead of the bare figure for a disk breach because D21's lever rule
  requires it: "this volume has grown every day for thirteen days" is the
  sentence a human actually needs, not an isolated byte count. Every other
  figure the report carries — a container's own latest/median, a resource
  nobody has budgeted — stays out of this badge on the same "routine, one
  click away in the raw record" reasoning the host-facts badge above
  already gives for per-container memory/cpu; the full report is in
  `D.fleet[<node>].resources` for anyone reading it directly. No badge when
  the row carries no `resources` field at all.
- **A node-scoped disable (implementation spec 2.3, `--disable --this-node`,
  issue #379) gets its own badge beside the role badge**, not just the
  page-top switch banner. The banner (above) is keyed to *this* node's own
  switch, so it already covers a node-scoped disable on the node whose page
  you are reading — but the fleet strip shows every node, and a peer's own
  node-scoped disable sets no fleet flag and appears in no banner at all.
  Without a per-card badge, a peer stood down that way is indistinguishable
  from an idle one, on the same page that goes to some trouble to say so for
  a fleet-wide disable. Amber, **disabled**, titled with the reason, who set
  it and its expiry — the same three facts the switch banner leads with, read
  through the same `toggle_switch_summary` (`lib/toggle.sh`) so the two
  cannot disagree (requirement 34a). Renders nothing when the node is
  enabled, and nothing when the field is absent (a peer's heartbeat from
  before this check existed) — the same absent-means-unknown rule the
  compose and image badges already follow, never a false "enabled" for a
  peer this node cannot actually answer for.

  It also renders nothing for a record tagged `scope: "fleet"` while the fleet
  flag is set: that record is the mirror a fleet-wide `--disable` leaves on the
  node that issued it, and badging it would single that node out of a fleet
  that is uniformly down. A mirror whose fleet flag has since been cleared is
  the exception and the reason the tag is worth carrying — it badges amber and
  says what it is, since that node is genuinely down alone and no banner on the
  page explains why. A record with no `scope` reads as `"node"`, matching
  `lib/toggle.sh`.
- **Blocked and void are shown as separate lists**, never merged into
  "items not being worked". They ask opposite things of the person reading:
  a blocked item may need them to clear its path; a void item needs nothing
  unless the verdict itself is wrong, and reopening one is a deliberate act
  only they can perform (appending `unvoided` to the log by hand — say so on
  the page, since it is the only escape hatch and it exists nowhere in the
  UI). Collapsing them costs the operator the one distinction the pipeline
  cannot make for itself.

  Separate lists means *separate*: an item holding both marks is void
  (implementation spec 34h) and belongs to the void list alone, which is why
  `blocked[]` is `open_blocked_items` and not `blocked_items`. It is not a
  corner case. `item-void` clears no block, so every `void` verdict the Enabler
  reaches — its ordinary way of retiring work that turned out to be already
  done — leaves the `attempt-failed` before it standing, and the page listed the
  item in both tables from then on. On the fleet that found this, fifteen of the
  sixteen rows under "Blocked items" were items the pipeline had already
  finished with, the oldest of them a fortnight dead, and the panel that exists
  to say *the pipeline is stuck on these* was reporting a backlog that had been
  cleared. The heading's count is the part that misleads fastest: it is read at
  a glance, by someone deciding whether to intervene at all.

  **The void list is capped and the blocked list is not**, for the same reason
  they are separate. Void is the page's one unbounded list of work nobody need
  act on: rows only accumulate — a hand-appended `unvoided` is the sole way one
  leaves — while the panels that do want an answer sit below it, so left whole
  it eventually pushes failed cycles and the work sources off the screen with a
  list whose entire message is "nothing to do here". Blocked is the opposite
  and is never capped: hiding a row there hides work. So void shows its ten
  newest rows, each clipped to three lines, and both caps open where they are —
  a `See more` at the foot of the table, any row expanding to its full text on
  a click — because the Enabler's reason *is* the row, and a truncation that
  could not be undone would leave the one question a void item ever raises
  ("is this verdict right?") unanswerable on the page. The heading keeps
  counting every void item rather than the rows shown, so the number read at a
  glance stays the fleet's.

  Ordering is part of that cap, not a nicety beside it: `void_items` groups by
  repo and item, so a cap over the list as it arrives keeps whichever ids sort
  first, which answers no question anyone has. The page sorts newest-first
  before slicing, making the kept rows the ten most recent verdicts — the ones
  a mistaken void is most likely to be among, and the only ones whose `Since`
  column then reads in order.

  The blocked list then makes one further distinction *within* itself, in its
  `Escalated` column: an item waiting on a human through an open issue, versus
  one still the pipeline's own to clear. That column is a link when the Enabler
  has raised an escalation (implementation spec 36a) and the Enabler's last
  verdict otherwise, because those are two quite different messages to the
  reader — "nothing will happen here until you act" and "the pipeline looked at
  this properly and is still working on it". Before it, both rendered as an
  identical row of prose, and the one item on the page that had been *addressed
  to the operator* looked exactly like the four that had not. The link is
  deliberately the escalation issue rather than a copy of its text: the issue is
  where the ask is maintained, and closing it is the whole protocol.

  A blocked row also carries `kind` (implementation spec 34e), and a row whose
  `kind` is `needs-refinement` gets a **refinement** badge and counts toward a
  "hide N refinement blocks" filter beside the panel's heading (TD26072603). An
  ordinary block is waiting on the world — a merge, a fix, an answer already
  asked for — and the Co-Ordinator is expected to clear it once that changes. A
  refinement block is waiting on the pipeline's own Enabler and, past one
  refinement, on escalation — `escalation_autonomy` deciding whether that
  reaches a human straightaway or is adjudicated first: reading "blocked: 9"
  with no way to tell the two populations apart understates how much of the
  backlog is a specification gap rather than a stalled merge. The filter
  defaults to showing both — hiding is
  an explicit, per-session choice, never the page's default view — because the
  count in the heading is itself information ("that many things need
  attention"), and defaulting to hidden would bury exactly the population this
  change exists to surface.
- **The live indicator says what, not just that.** The header's running dot
  once reported only that a cycle was in flight and since when; the item it was
  working on lived several panels down, in the cycles table. But "what is the
  pipeline doing right now?" is the exact question a glance at the header is
  for, and making the operator scroll to answer it defeats the point of having a
  live indicator at all. So the running state now carries `status.current` — the
  live stage and the selected work — rendered inline beside the dot, reusing the
  same source-tag vocabulary as the cycles column so the two read as one thing.
  It is *derived, not newly logged*: the id/pid tie between the lock and the
  running cycle's events is enough to reconstruct it from state already on disk,
  so the reader gains the answer without the pipeline emitting anything new or
  the Publisher making an extra call. The fields appear in the order the cycle
  learns them — stage first, then repo/item/title once the Co-Ordinator selects
  — which doubles as a coarse progress read: a header stuck on `coordinator`
  with no item is a cycle still choosing; one naming an item under `implementer`
  is a cycle at work.
- **With a fleet, "what is it doing" has one answer per node, so it is asked per
  node.** The readout above was designed when a node and the pipeline were the
  same thing, and it sat in the header because there was one of it. Once several
  containers run at once, a single header readout has to pick one node's work to
  stand for every node's — and whichever it picks, the reading a glance takes
  from it ("the pipeline is on TD26071401") is false. So the live state moved
  down to the fleet strip, one full readout per card, beside the identity and
  freshness that say whose it is; the header keeps the shape of the question it
  can still answer for the whole fleet — *how much of it is working* — and drops
  the part it cannot. A single-node page is unchanged, header detail included:
  with one node there is nothing to summarise, and the fleet strip does not
  render at all.

  Three things follow from a peer's state being *derived from its published log*
  rather than observed. Its card is dated ("as of its last push, 2m ago") rather
  than presented as now. A peer whose heartbeat has gone stale reports **state
  unknown** instead of last half-hour's news dressed as current — the one
  reading that would be actively misleading. And a cycle still "running" past
  `lock_stale_after` is flagged as possibly dead, because a node killed
  mid-cycle leaves precisely the trace of one still working: a `cycle-start`
  with no end, for ever. Our own row is exempt from all three — the lock is a
  live pid, not an inference — but it gets the mirror-image case: a dead lock
  over an unfinished cycle is reported as **no clean end**, which is what a
  stopped container leaves behind and which "idle" would quietly
  absorb.

  A fourth reaches the same verdict far sooner, and is the one that fires in
  practice. A stage still live past its own backstop has outlived the timer
  that would have killed it, so the cycle is over whatever the log says; a
  Co-Ordinator is bounded in tens of minutes where `lock_stale_after` is
  several hours, and a node rolled mid-cycle sat in that gap reading
  "coordinator choosing work". The cap it is held against is the one that
  stage was given, announced on its own `stage-start` (requirement 4f), so the
  rule follows a backstop that moves without needing to be told. Judged against the node's own heartbeat, never the reader's clock, so
  the verdict is about what that node published and not about how long ago it
  published it. Our own row is **not** exempt from this one, unlike the three
  above: a live pid proves the cycle script is alive, not that the stage it
  last logged still is — and were that script alive, its own timer would have
  ended the stage.
- **The page refreshes its data in place, not by reloading.** The heartbeat
  once published every 5 minutes and the page reloaded itself every 60s with
  `location.reload()`. When the heartbeat moved to ~5s
  (`publish-dashboard-launcher.sh`), a full reload every few seconds was
  unusable: it collapsed every expanded cycle row, closed open transcripts,
  flashed the screen and snapped scroll to the top. So the one-shot render was
  made re-runnable and the refresh now re-fetches `data.js` and re-renders in
  place. Two properties keep that cheap and non-disruptive. It re-renders
  **only when the data actually changed** — comparing a signature that omits
  `generated_at` (which moves every publish) — so an idle pipeline's open tabs
  sit perfectly still. And the fetch is an **injected cache-busted `<script>`,
  not `fetch()`**, so the page keeps loading from a `file://` URL with no
  server and no CORS — the same reason the initial load uses a plain
  `<script src>`. Expanded rows, open `<details>` and scroll position are
  carried across the re-render in two small keyed maps. One deliberate
  consequence of only-on-change: the relative "3m ago" cells stop advancing
  while the pipeline is idle and catch up the moment new data lands — the
  header's own staleness clock keeps ticking, so freshness is never in doubt.
- **`data.js` itself is only fetched when it might have changed** (issue
  #1288). "Cheap and non-disruptive" above was still true only *after*
  paying to download `data.js` on every tick — 2.7–2.9 MB measured on real
  nodes, continuously, whether or not the underlying state had moved: about
  45 GB/day per tab left open, and over a slow enough path (agent-ops#1286)
  a single tick took longer than the interval it was fired at, so the tab
  never caught up at all. The fix keeps the cache-busted `<script>`
  injection (a tab still needs no server) but adds a second, few-dozen-byte
  sibling, `stamp.js`, carrying `{generated_at, fingerprint}` — the
  Publisher's own no-op-skip fingerprint (below), which by construction
  changes exactly when `data.js`'s content might have. Every tick fetches
  `stamp.js`; `data.js` follows only when its `fingerprint` differs from the
  one the tab last loaded. `generated_at` still ticks the header clock on
  every tick regardless, so the staleness display is exactly as live as
  before — only the multi-megabyte fetch became conditional. Two follow-up
  correctness fixes to the first version of this: a `data.js` fetch that
  failed used to advance the tab's fingerprint anyway, permanently wedging it
  on stale data with no retry; and the page's first load — a plain
  `<script src>` pair, not the refresh tick's cache-busted one — used to seed
  that fingerprint from `stamp.js`, which a publish landing between the two
  requests could answer for a newer publish than the `data.js` the tab
  actually got. See "the client" above for both.
- **The dequeued warning is the Publisher's own memory, not GitHub's timeline**
  (agent-ops#375, D17). The obvious first design reads `merge_queue_probe`'s
  `dequeued_at`/`dequeue_reason` straight through — the same fields
  `scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh` already posts a notice from — but that
  field answers "when did this pull request last leave the queue", not "does
  it need a human's attention right now", and the two come apart exactly the
  way agent-ops#394 found against the sweep's own use of it: the timeline
  read fires on a removal from arbitrarily long ago, even after a later
  re-queue, because nothing in it says "and nothing has changed since". A
  dashboard badge that could relight itself off ancient history is worse than
  none, so instead the Publisher keeps its own `{queued, warn}` per pull
  request across ticks (`<state_dir>/.dashboard-queue.json`) and derives
  `dequeued` from the transition it itself observes — `warn` sets the tick
  `queued` flips `true` → `false`, holds while it keeps reading `false`, and
  clears the moment `queued` reads `true` again. That is strictly a
  comparison this Publisher can make about *this* pull request's *current*
  state, never a re-reading of a GitHub event that predates the question.
- **A capped work source says how much it is hiding, not just what it shows**
  (agent-ops#1171). The open-issues panel reads one REST page (`per_page=30`)
  and the tech-debt panel keeps only the top 40 rows, both for the reasons
  given above — but neither cap used to say so: a repo at 47 open issues or
  120 open tech-debt items rendered identically to one that genuinely had 28
  or 40, and the panel is headed "what the Co-Ordinator sees" on a page an
  operator reads precisely to judge whether the pipeline is keeping up.
  `issues_total` and `tech_debt_total` fix that without changing what either
  cap fetches or shows. The issues listing is a plain REST page with no
  `.total_count` of its own, so its total costs a second call — the Search
  API's `.total_count` (the same read `lib/pager-invariants.sh` already makes
  for a different invariant) — best-effort and never promoted to a real
  failure: it is its own endpoint with its own, tighter rate limit, and a
  miss on a cosmetic total the main listing never needed has no business
  joining `gh_fail_msgs` or flipping `github.ok` — it simply leaves
  `issues_total` `null`, which the page reads exactly as it read a `data.js`
  from before the field existed. The tech-debt listing, by contrast, *is*
  already a Search API call (issue #881), so its own `.total_count` comes
  back in the same response as the rows — free, and always a number whenever
  that one call answered at all. The page itself only ever adds text: "N of
  M" replaces a bare count solely where the total is a known number greater
  than what is shown, so a healthy, uncapped repo (`total` absent, `null`, or
  equal to the count) renders precisely as it always has.
- **The tech-debt ledger reads a label search, not the frozen register**
  (issue #881, following D15 as revised, #869). Every register in the fleet
  is now frozen (#880 and its sibling issues in the other repositories) and
  tech debt lives instead as `pw::type:tech-debt`-labelled GitHub issues, so
  the `contents/tech-debt` listing this panel used to read had quietly
  stopped answering the live ledger — it still returned 200, but against an
  archive that no longer grows. The fix reads the same source the
  Co-Ordinator itself now does (`scripts/gather-tech-debt.sh`): a search for
  open `pw::type:tech-debt` issues. The dashboard's own read is a plain
  Search API call rather than that gatherer's paginated GraphQL walk,
  because the panel only ever needs `{id, title, status, url}` and a total —
  never the issue bodies or comment threads that walk exists to fetch. This
  also retired the per-tick miss budget and the blob-SHA-keyed metadata
  cache (`<state_dir>/.dashboard-td.json`) the old listing needed: a search
  answers every row it can show in the one call that also answers the total,
  so there is nothing left to warm across ticks.
  `scripts/gather-register-status.sh` was considered for retirement alongside
  this change but left untouched: it answers a different question (whether a
  `Blocked-by:` reference naming a pre-freeze register id has since
  resolved, implementation-pipeline-spec requirement 34i) for a caller
  (`lib/candidate-select.sh`) that has nothing to do with this panel, and
  retiring it would have silently broken that caller's own legacy-reference
  clearance.
