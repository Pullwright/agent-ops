# Re-homing agent-ops in the Pullwright organisation — runbook

**Status: preparation.** The transfer has not happened. This document is the
plan of record for it, tracked by #912 (owner acts, `blocked` so the pipeline
never selects it). It is a planning document, not an as-built specification:
it describes what will be done and in what order; the as-built specs remain
the authority on what *is*. When a step lands, tick it in #912 and amend
this document where the evidence overtook it.

Assessment this runbook condenses (2026-08-28, with its GitHub-documentation
sources): <https://claude.ai/code/artifact/e6519e84-d138-4ea4-8b6e-483e84d98e4b>.

## The decision

`Poetic-Poems/agent-ops` — the repository, its history, its issues and pull
requests, its ruleset — is **transferred** to the Pullwright organisation and
becomes the product repository in place. It **stays public**: D5 (reaffirmed
2026-08-28, #909) makes the public code the marketing, and the private
option is what carried most of the cost — the Team-plan upgrade for a ruleset
on a private repository, a private registry with a login on every node, the
loss of code scanning (paid on private) and of the merge queue (Enterprise
Cloud only on private). None of that applies to a public organisation
repository.

This is one way of doing the Phase 1 D8 item, and the cheaper way. D8 said
"a new product repository holds the pipeline; agent-ops shrinks to Poetic's
consumer configuration". GitHub moves issues only within one owner, so
whichever direction the split runs, one class of issues is stranded — and
this repository's issues are overwhelmingly the pipeline's own. Moving the
repository keeps the pipeline with its issues, its D18 evidence and its
Approver; the small consumer half is extracted afterwards into a new,
differently named repository in Poetic-Poems (GitHub retires
`Poetic-Poems/agent-ops` on transfer, so the name cannot be reused). D8 is
amended to say so.

## What the transfer carries, and what it does not

GitHub transfers issues, pull requests, wiki, stars, watchers, releases and
settings (the `default` branch ruleset included), keeps every commit, and
redirects `git clone`/`fetch`/`push` and every web link from the old
location until something is created at it — which the retirement forbids.
The repository has no webhooks, no Actions secrets or variables, no deploy
keys, no Pages site; every workflow declares its own `permissions:` block,
so the receiving organisation's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` policy does not
matter.

Three things do not follow a repository across an organisation boundary.
Each touches the running fleet, which is why the move is a runbook and not
a click.

1. **Every node's `GH_TOKEN` is a fine-grained PAT, and a fine-grained PAT
   reaches exactly one owner.** ("Each token is limited to access resources
   owned by a single user or organization.") Reads of a public repository
   keep working; the branches, pull requests, issues, labels and comments
   the pipeline writes into agent-ops do not, and the same token still has
   to write to `poetic`, `poetic-fiddle` and `agent-ops-state` in
   Poetic-Poems. See "Credential model" below.
2. **The image is the deployment artefact, and it lives in
   `ghcr.io/poetic-poems/`.** `/app` inside it *is* agent-ops
   (`.github/workflows/build-image.yml`). GHCR packages belong to the
   organisation namespace, not the repository: on transfer the package's
   link to the repository is removed and the transferred repository's
   workflows lose access to it. So `build-image.yml` must publish to
   `ghcr.io/pullwright/agent-ops`, and every node's `AGENT_OPS_IMAGE` must
   follow — otherwise `:latest` in the old namespace goes stale and every
   node silently stops rolling, the failure mode `deploy/docker/README.md`'s
   "Is this node on the newest image" section exists for. Anonymous pulls
   keep working; no registry login is needed.
3. **A GitHub App installation is per organisation, so the Approver's own
   installation does not follow the repository.**
   `pullwright-approver-poetic` is installed on
   Poetic-Poems; agent-ops leaves that installation's scope on transfer.
   #913 (landed) resolved this ahead of the transfer:
   `lib/approver-token.sh` now resolves the installation id per repository
   owner (`PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_IDS`, falling back to the scalar
   `PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_ID`), and `scripts/doctor.sh`'s
   installation checks run once per distinct installation rather than
   assuming one covers every repository. What remains for this transfer is
   the owner act #913 left out of its own scope: installing
   `pullwright-approver-poetic` on Pullwright too (or transferring it there)
   with `contents: write`, `metadata: read`, `pull_requests: write`, and
   recording the resulting installation id in
   `PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_IDS` on every node.

Two lesser effects: the `Priority` issue field is organisation-scoped
(Pullwright already defines one with the same four options; whether values
survive a cross-organisation transfer is undocumented — the rehearsal below
answers it), and claims in the state repository are keyed by slug
(`claims/Poetic-Poems__agent-ops/…`), so the cutover happens with the fleet
stood down and any straggler ages out through `claim_ttl_hours`.

## Order

Every step is marked *owner act* (performed by @warwickallen, on GitHub or
on a node) or *fleet* (an ordinary pull request the pipeline can build).

### Rehearsal — *owner act*, 20 minutes, no fleet impact

1. Create `Poetic-Poems/rehome-rehearsal`, public. Open one issue and set
   `Priority: High`. Add a default-branch ruleset copying `default`'s rules.
2. Transfer it to Pullwright. Check: is the Priority value still on the
   issue? Is the ruleset intact?
3. Delete the repository. If the Priority value was lost, plan to re-band
   agent-ops's open issues after T0 (47 of 57 carried a band on 2026-08-28);
   unbanded issues read as `Medium` and the Refiner's ratchet rebuilds the
   rest over time.

### Before T0

- [ ] The docs PR — this runbook and the D8 amendment. *fleet or owner*
- [ ] #913 — per-owner Approver installation. *fleet*
- [ ] Make `pullwright-approver-poetic` installable outside its owner
      account (App settings → "Where can this GitHub App be installed?"), or
      transfer the App to the Pullwright organisation; install it on
      Pullwright with `contents: write`, `metadata: read`,
      `pull_requests: write`; note the installation id. *owner act*
- [ ] Mint four personal access tokens (classic) — `repo`, `workflow`,
      `read:org` — one per node, each with an expiry; confirm Pullwright's
      organisation settings allow classic tokens. Check the first one against
      "Credential model" below before minting the other three. *owner act*
- [ ] The sweep PR (`chore: re-home under Pullwright — slug and image
      sweep`): opened against the old slug, kept green, **not merged**. Its
      `config.json` names a repository that does not exist until T0, and its
      `build-image.yml` publishes to a namespace the Poetic-Poems
      repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push to. *fleet keeps it rebased*

### T0 — *owner act*, about an hour with the fleet stood down

1. Stand the fleet down and wait for the running cycles to finish:
   ```bash
   docker exec agent-ops-scheduler-1 /app/agent-cycle.sh --disable 'agent-ops re-homing' --for 3h
   # then, on each node, until it exits 0:
   docker exec agent-ops-scheduler-1 /app/deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh; echo $?
   ```
2. Transfer the repository: agent-ops → Settings → Danger zone → Transfer →
   `Pullwright`. Confirm the redirect: `gh repo view Poetic-Poems/agent-ops`
   resolves to `Pullwright/agent-ops`.
3. Merge the sweep PR (rebase first if `main` moved; pushes to the old remote
   redirect). Watch "Build the node image" publish
   `ghcr.io/pullwright/agent-ops:latest`. Open the new package's settings:
   it is **private by default** when a package is first published by a workflow
   into a fresh namespace, and must be switched to public. (Note: GHCR returns
   `denied` for both a private package and a non-existent one, so if
   `docker compose pull` fails between the merge and the publish run finishing,
   check the "Publish to GHCR" workflow to tell whether `:latest` is not yet
   published or published-but-private — the workflow runs only on `push` to
   `refs/heads/main`, not on merge-queue runs, so `:latest` can briefly not
   exist between a merge and the push-triggered publish completing. The
   repository link needs no action: `build-image.yml` already sets
   `org.opencontainers.image.source`, which links the package automatically.)
4. On each node — `~/poetic-node-1` (ockham-container), `~/poetic-node-2`
   (ockham-2), `/opt/poetic-node` (poetic-1), `/opt/poetic-node-2`
   (poetic-2). A running container keeps the `.env` it was created with, so
   the recreate is the step, not the edit:
   ```bash
   $EDITOR .env   # GH_TOKEN=<this node's classic token>
                  # AGENT_OPS_IMAGE=ghcr.io/pullwright/agent-ops:latest
                  # the per-owner Approver installation variable #913 settles on
   until docker exec agent-ops-scheduler-1 /app/deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 30; done
   # ⚠️ docker compose up -d reads .env only via interpolation (compose.yaml has no env_file:),
   # so a GH_TOKEN exported in the shell will override the .env value just edited.
   # Run this from a shell with no GH_TOKEN exported, or unset GH_TOKEN first.
   docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
   docker compose ps -a --format "table {{.Name}}\t{{.Service}}\t{{.Status}}"   # one row per profiled service
   docker exec agent-ops-scheduler-1 /app/scripts/doctor.sh                       # token writes to both owners; App covers agent-ops
   ```
   From the workstation, `helper-scripts/env-key-hash.sh GH_TOKEN` must show
   no node as `STALE`.
5. Re-point the workstation clone:
   `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Pullwright/agent-ops.git`.
6. `--enable`, and watch the first cycle on each node: it selects and clones
   under the new slug, the Approver reviews an agent-ops pull request, and
   `failed-runs` is empty.

### Aftercare

- [ ] Release any claim still under `claims/Poetic-Poems__agent-ops/` in the
      state repository, or leave it to expire.
- [ ] Delete or leave `ghcr.io/poetic-poems/agent-ops` — it is public and
      contains nothing the repository does not.
- [ ] `Poetic-Poems/helper-scripts/count-autonomous-agent-prs.sh` reads
      `config.json` from the old slug; one line.
- [ ] Dashboard history keeps the old slug on pre-move records, so per-repo
      panels show two agent-ops rows for a while; cosmetic. The daily merge
      budget for agent-ops restarts.
- [ ] Tick #912 and amend this document where the rehearsal or the cutover
      overtook it.

## Credential model

Until D25's Forge App exists, each node's `GH_TOKEN` becomes a personal
access token (classic) with `repo`, `workflow` and `read:org`. It reaches
every owner the fleet writes to, needs no code change, and keeps "one token
per node, so a single node can be revoked without disturbing the others".

`repo` must be the full scope rather than `public_repo`: three of the four
repositories are public, but the state repository
`Poetic-Poems/agent-ops-state` is private. It carries the rest of the
fine-grained set with it — contents, issues, pull requests, actions
(dispatch, rerun, cancel) — and the security-alert read that `README.md`'s
code-scanning section already notes `repo` satisfies on a classic token.
`workflow` is separate and not implied by `repo`; it is what lets a cycle's
pull request touch `.github/workflows/`.

`read:org` is not wanted by any call the pipeline makes. It is wanted by
`gh` itself, and only once the token is classic. `gh`'s minimum-scope check
(`HeaderHasMinimumScopes`, `pkg/cmd/auth/shared/oauth_scopes.go`) returns
early when the `X-Oauth-Scopes` response header is empty — which is exactly
what a fine-grained PAT sends, so the check has never once run against this
fleet. A classic token populates that header, the check runs for real, and
it requires `repo` *and* one of `read:org`/`write:org`/`admin:org`. Without
it `gh auth status` exits non-zero, so `scripts/doctor.sh` reports "gh is
not authenticated — run 'gh auth login' or set GH_TOKEN" and leaves
`gh_ready` clear, skipping the per-repository push-permission checks, the
`Priority`-field probe and the token-expiry reading — the three checks T0
step 4 leans on as its acceptance gate. The message would be wrong and the
gate blind, on four nodes at once, at the one moment the doctor has to be
believable.

No `project` scope is needed: `Priority` is a repository/organisation
`IssueFieldSingleSelect` reached through `repository.issueFields`
(`lib/issue-priority.sh`), not a Projects v2 field, so `repo` covers both
the read and `setIssueFieldValue`. `scripts/doctor.sh` probes it per
repository and says so outright, rather than leaving it to be inferred.

Mint each token with an expiry: GitHub states a classic token's expiry in
the same `GitHub-Authentication-Token-Expiration` response header any other
personal access token with an expiry carries, so requirement 2.7a's warning
— the guard #694 built after the 2026-08-22 fleet-wide expiry outage (#691)
— survives the cutover unchanged.

Check the first token before minting the other three — the two things most
likely to surprise are one command apart:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=<the new token> bash -c '
  gh auth status; echo "auth status exit: $?"
  gh api rate_limit --include 2>/dev/null \
    | grep -i "^github-authentication-token-expiration:"
  for r in Poetic-Poems/poetic Poetic-Poems/poetic-fiddle \
           Poetic-Poems/agent-ops-state Pullwright/agent-ops; do
    printf "%-30s push=%s\n" "$r" \
      "$(gh api "repos/$r" --jq .permissions.push 2>&1 | head -1)"
  done'
```

Wanting: exit 0 from `auth status` with all three scopes listed, an
expiration header, and `push=true` — `Pullwright/agent-ops` answers `404`
until step 2 of T0 has run, and `push=true` from then on.

What the interim gives up is the fine-grained model's repository-level
scoping: a classic `repo` token sees every repository its owner can. The
alternative — two fine-grained tokens per node and a per-owner selection in
front of every
`gh` call — touches every call site and the doctor's token checks, for a
property D25 delivers anyway; it is not worth building twice. The Forge App
(#607, D25) retires the interim: one installation per organisation, each
minting short-lived tokens scoped to that organisation's repositories.

## What was dropped, and why

The private option (Team plan, private image with `docker login` on every
node, `lib/image-drift.sh` authenticating to the registry, removal of
CodeQL and its ruleset rules, loss of the merge queue) was assessed on
2026-08-28 and dropped the same day when D5 was reaffirmed: a public
repository is the product's marketing, and the private half owned most of
the cost. Should it ever return, the assessment linked at the top carries
the full sequence.
