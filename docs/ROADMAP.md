## Vision

The Autonomous Implementation Pipeline becomes **Pullwright**
([github.com/Pullwright](https://github.com/Pullwright)) — a monetised
product that any software team can point at their repositories: an
unattended fleet that selects, implements, and reviews pending work and
raises mergeable pull requests, with a human merge as the default gate —
and, where an installation deliberately opts in, a trust ladder that
retires even that (D18).
Poetic-Poems stops being the pipeline's home and becomes its first
customer.

## Settled decisions

Decided July 2026 unless a row says otherwise; these shape every phase
below. Reopen them only deliberately, by editing this table in a PR that
says why.

| # | Decision | Choice |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | First phase | **Untether first** — generalise the pipeline out of Poetic-Poems before building platform or launch features. |
| D2 | Delivery model | **Deliberately open** (self-hosted product vs hosted SaaS vs both) until the explicit decision gate at Phase 4. Until then, every phase does only work that serves both paths. |
| D3 | Target customers | Solo developers and small teams; open-source maintainers; mid-size engineering organisations. Not (yet) agencies running many client repos. |
| D4 | Model-usage billing | **BYO API key is the primary, first-class path** — Anthropic first (including Claude via Bedrock and Vertex), and likewise for every other supported provider (D12). Claude subscription OAuth is retained as a supported self-hosted configuration, documented with its constraints (interactive login per node; own-use only). Usage resale is deferred until a hosted SaaS exists and has traction, but metering hooks are designed in from Phase 1 so resale needs no re-architecture. |
| D5 | Licensing | **Source-available, under the Functional Source License (FSL-1.1-ALv2).** Source-available was decided July 2026; the licence itself, and what it does and does not decide, August 2026. The code is public and auditable. The licence's one restriction is FSL's *Competing Use*: nobody may build a product or service, hosted or self-hosted, that competes with Pullwright from Pullwright's code; each release converts to Apache 2.0 two years after it is published. That is all the licence decides. It is **not** a pricing promise. The earlier wording — "free to self-host for your own use" — conflated the two, and together with BYO keys (D4) and the both-paths rule it left the self-hosted path, the only path that exists until Phase 4, with nothing to charge for. What is free and what is paid is the revenue model's question (D26); FSL leaves a commercial licence and entitlement-keyed tiers open on top of it. Why the code stays public when the product exists to make money: the threat the BSL family was built against — a hyperscaler reselling the product as a service — is not this product's threat, and the companies that relicensed against it in 2023–24 have largely relicensed back (Redis and Elastic to AGPL) because the adoption it cost outweighed what it protected. Pullwright's risk is not being copied but not being found, and a public repository whose fleet visibly raises and lands its own pull requests is the only marketing D11's hours-a-week budget can afford. The product's defining act (D24) is holding write credentials while reading untrusted text; D3's first two segments — solo developers and open-source maintainers — will not hand that to a closed binary, and a mid-size organisation's security review will ask to read it. The bash engine is not the asset; the reasoning in this table is, and it is already public. And a private repository would cost the product's own development the merge queue (D17: Enterprise-only on private repositories), paid code scanning and metered Actions minutes — a regression on exactly the D18 rungs the autonomy-parity rule (Principle 8) requires the product repository to demonstrate. FSL over BSL because it has one restriction, one clock and two possible future licences (Sentry and Liquibase precedent); the Apache 2.0 future licence over MIT for its patent grant. The licence names a licensor — the entity that will sell Pullwright — settled with the trademark search (GTM) before the licence carries the name. |
| D6 | Technology | **Strangler rewrite.** The proven bash cycle engine is retained. All *new* product surface — control plane, config APIs, packaging — is written in a proper language; engine pieces migrate across only when a change touches them anyway. |
| D7 | Product scope | **The whole suite**: the implementation pipeline, the **repository-review** pipeline, and the dashboard. They compound — reviews feed the pipeline the work it does, and the dashboard is the product's face. The name the review pipeline carries today, *weekly project review*, is wrong twice over, and neither word survives productisation. **Weekly** is configuration, not identity: the cadence is a cron tick plus `project_review.defaults.min_days_between_reviews`, set per installation and overridable per repository, so a nightly or fortnightly installation is as ordinary as Poetic's weekly one — the Phase 1 sweep retires the word from both pipelines. **Project** overstates the scope: a run reviews *one repository*, each entry in `project_review.repos` on its own, with its own clone, branch, report set and pull request; nothing reviews a project — several repositories that deliver one thing — as a single subject. Reviewing one as a single subject is a wanted feature, deliberately deferred (Phase 3). Until then the product's term is **repository review** — and a review is instructed and contextualised per repository (Phase 1), because what a repository is for, which of its oddities are deliberate, and what is out of scope for it are not things a reviewer can reliably infer from the clone alone. |
| D8 | Repository shape | **Split, by transfer.** Amended 2026-08-28, from "a new product repository in the Pullwright organisation holds the pipeline; agent-ops shrinks to Poetic's consumer configuration and deployment": agent-ops itself — its history, its issues and pull requests, its D18 evidence — is transferred to the Pullwright organisation (D13) and becomes the product repository in place, public under D5; Poetic's consumer configuration and deployment are then extracted into a new, differently named repository in Poetic-Poems — the reference installation and customer zero. Transfer rather than extract because GitHub moves issues only within one owner and this repository's issues are overwhelmingly the pipeline's own, and because the fleet's autonomy level, Approver and evidence travel with the repository instead of being re-provisioned. GitHub retires `Poetic-Poems/agent-ops` on transfer, so the consumer repository cannot inherit the name. The move is an owner act with a runbook, `docs/PULLWRIGHT-REHOMING.md` (#912). |
| D9 | Build mode | **Mixed.** Architectural moves happen in interactive sessions; everything decomposable is authored as agent-workable items that the fleet works down itself. The roadmap doubles as dogfooding evidence. |
| D10 | Pacing | **Phase-gated, no dates.** Progress is gates passed, not calendar time. |
| D11 | Go-to-market | **A parallel lightweight workstream from Phase 1**: the name is chosen early (it gates the repo split), design partners are recruited during untethering, and pricing is tested before anything launches. |
| D12 | Model providers | **Not limited to the Claude family.** Customers choose the model for each actor from any supported provider. Claude is the first-supported and reference provider; how non-Claude providers are executed (the substrate question) is parked in Open questions with a decide-by gate. |
| D13 | Product name | **Pullwright.** Decided July 2026, ahead of its Phase 1 gate; the GitHub organisation ([github.com/Pullwright](https://github.com/Pullwright)) is created and the namespace secured. |
| D14 | Efficiency | **Per-container efficiency is an explicit product goal from the start.** Decided August 2026. Every container is held to budgets for CPU load, memory footprint, disk usage, and bandwidth, alongside — never at the expense of — quality and speed of delivery. Where these pull against each other, the trade-off is a calculated decision recorded in the change that makes it, never an accident discovered on a bill. Kubernetes requests and limits (Phase 2) become one enforcement mechanism, but the budgets exist whatever the control plane. |
| D15 | Tech-debt management | **The tech-debt management framework is part of the offering — and its store is the forge's issue tracker, not an in-repo register.** Decided August 2026; revised 2026-08-28. The per-item register proved the discipline — append-only records, race-safe concurrent human and agent writers, CI enforcement, debt worked down by the pipeline as an ordinary source — and its own founding mechanics are what retire it: per-item files existed so adjacent work could not textually conflict, and the `td/<id>` ref-push lock existed so ID allocation was collision-proof, both properties the forge supplies natively (issues cannot conflict; issue numbers allocate atomically). Its operating cost is equally on the record: every filing took a full pull-request cycle with a human approval — near-pure overhead under D21 — and the machinery around it (vendored tooling, drift workflows, reservation cleanup, orphan-branch carve-outs) generated exactly the meta-work class D20 exists to retire. Debt therefore lives as GitHub Issues carrying the product-managed label `pw::type:tech-debt`: a stage files debt in one API call — no branch, no reservation, no pull request, no approval; the `tech-debt` work band selects on the label, which only collaborators with triage can apply — the D24 trust anchor, issue bodies remaining untrusted data; a resolving pull request closes the issue (`Fixes #n`) and carries a structured record block in its body, which the squash merge writes into `main`'s immutable history (repositories set `squash_merge_commit_message` to `PR_BODY`); a close-guard holds an issue closed without a pull request to a stated resolution (`not_planned` inheriting `not-debt`'s meaning); and an append-only archive mirror in the state store preserves every labelled item — body, state, close reason — past the mutable working store. Accepted eyes-open, in D24's manner: an issue's body is editable where a register file on `main` was not, so the permanent record moves from `git log --follow` on an item file to the squash-commit body plus the mirror; that trade is this revision's price, and it is bounded by the mirror's history and the forge's own immutable timeline events. Existing registers freeze in place as history: no item file is deleted, every `tech-debt/TD-*` citation keeps resolving, and each open item is migrated to a labelled issue its file then names. |
| D16 | Infrastructure as code | **The configuration of the pipeline and of the orchestration layer / control plane is infrastructure-as-code.** Decided August 2026. Everything that configures an installation — `config.json`, compose files and Kubernetes manifests, schedules, secrets wiring, per-node deployment shape — is declared in version-controlled code and reaches a running installation only by applying a versioned change, never by hand-editing a live node. Today compose- and env-level fixes are walked out to each node by hand, and the drift detection of #131 exists to catch exactly the divergence that this rule makes structurally impossible. Phase 2's deployment-as-artefact and Kubernetes items are the first enforcement, and the control-plane skeleton (D6) grows up under the same rule. |
| D17 | Merge queues | **Supported and recommended where available; never required.** Decided August 2026. A GitHub merge queue serialises landings and tests every candidate merged with the latest `main`, retiring the behind-but-green rework class that strict up-to-date rules otherwise create — Poetic-Poems adopts queues on its own repositories (tracked by #377). The product cannot mandate them: GitHub offers merge queues only on organisation-owned repositories — public on any plan, private only on Enterprise Cloud — and never on personal accounts, where D3's solo developers live. The pipeline therefore stays fully functional without a queue and becomes queue-aware where one exists: landings are asynchronous, a pull request can be `queued` or silently dequeued, and a push to a queued branch evicts it. Under a queue the merge act is enqueueing ("Merge when ready"). Below `agent-merges-routine` on D18's ladder that act is the human's, and the product never enqueues a pull request, exactly as it never merges one; at or above it, enqueueing is the Script's landing step, performed only after every D18 gate has passed. |
| D18 | Merge autonomy | **An opt-in trust ladder; the default is the landing gate at `human`.** Decided August 2026 (investigation: `docs/reviews/2026-08-14-autonomy-investigation.md`; rollout umbrella #402). `merge_autonomy` — `human` → `agent-approves` → `agent-merges-routine` → `agent-merges-all` — sets, per installation and per repository, who approves and who lands a pull request. At every level above `human`, approval and landing are acts of the Script under a non-author forge identity (a GitHub App, "Pullwright Approver"), performed only after every deterministic gate and an independent Approver verdict pass; no model ever holds approve or merge rights, and a human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` blocks landing at every level. Where a merge queue exists, landing is enqueueing (amending D17); otherwise it is GitHub auto-merge (`gh pr merge --auto --squash`), which merges as soon as every **required** check is green and does not wait for a non-required check still running (TD-PPagop-26082101); an adopter who wants a check to hold a merge must mark that check required. Landings are capped by `merge_budget_per_day`, which replaces the human merge rate as the spend governor. The product default is `human`, unchanged from today — nothing a customer has not opted into ever lands a pull request. Poetic-Poems, customer zero, climbs the whole ladder. |
| D19 | Rendered-preview checking | **A tiered preview check, with the browser in a shared renderer — never in the agent images.** Decided August 2026. Reviewing a web change means seeing the page a user will see, and the pipeline today stops two tiers short: it verifies a preview *deployed* (answers 2xx on `/`), never what it *serves*, never what it *renders*. On poetic-fiddle#319 the CSP defect was caught only by a human clicking the deployed preview; on agent-ops#424 a Reviewer tried to stage a browser onto its node by hand, failed for want of root, and handed the eyeballing back to the human — the nodes already think to check, and are blocked by tooling, not by intent or credentials. The check becomes a three-tier ladder, each tier priced and entered only when the diff warrants it: **deployed** — the preview exists and answers (today's `preview-deploy.sh`); **served** — fetch the routes the diff touches and read the HTML and response headers statically through the deployment-protection bypass, no browser required (Content-Security-Policy headers are the proven catch); **rendered** — a real browser executes the page and returns screenshots, console output, and the resulting DOM as artefacts the reviewing stage reads. How a preview is *obtained* sits behind a per-repo `preview` block in config — an adapter interface with Vercel as the proven first provider, others by demand — and a repository with no preview deployment, or one whose owner withholds its build system's credentials, declares a **local fallback**: build and serve the pull-request head from commands stated in config, then check that. The browser itself ships in one separately-deployable renderer container per installation, serving every node on demand — the dashboard-split precedent, honouring D14 — so agent images stay browser-free, idle nodes pay nothing for a capability they use occasionally, and the preview credentials live server-side in the renderer rather than passing through an agent's transcript. A rendered page is untrusted input: its content reaches the reviewing model as data, never as instructions. |
| D20 | Tooling delivery | **The tooling a repository is maintained by belongs to the product, not to the repository.** Decided August 2026. Every repository-maintenance and development script the pipeline relies on — the lint, format, and drift-check helpers of the class; the tech-debt register's allocator, resolver, validator and CI guards were its founding case until D15's 2026-08-28 revision retired that machinery outright — is *vendored* today: one canonical copy in `Poetic-Poems/poetic`, byte-identical copies walked by hand into agent-ops, poetic-fiddle and the ArtistOS ports, each policed by its own weekly workflow diffing a hard-coded file list. The copying is the defect, not the copies, and every failure mode it has is now on the record: an upstream change to `td-check.pl` (poetic#180, 2026-08-14) left two consumers validating their registers with the old checker for as long as nobody re-copied it (#485); two scripts added the day before (poetic#166) reached no consumer at all, because a file that was never copied is absent from every hard-coded list, which is how #346 and #350 came to mint the same ID — and the fix for *that* (a published manifest, poetic#188/#191) makes the copying mechanism honest without retiring it; and each consumer's adoption is then its own tracked, human-shepherded work item (#468, poetic-fiddle#326). None of it survives contact with D3's customers, who cannot be asked to vendor the product's scripts, hand-sync them on every upstream fix, and carry a drift check per repository — that is the customer-zero rule failing in advance. In the end state a repository declares which maintenance capabilities it wants and Pullwright supplies the executables; the repository holds only its own data — its register items, its configuration — a fix reaches every installation by upgrading the product, and drift stops being a category of failure rather than a category of check. *How* they are delivered is an open question with a Phase 2 gate; *that* they are delivered rather than copied is not. |
| D21 | Productivity analytics | **The product measures the two rates it exists to raise — delivered work per elapsed hour, and delivered work per token — and no figure it publishes lacks a lever.** Decided August 2026. An installation's levers are few and enumerable: which model runs each actor (D12), how many nodes run, where the caps sit (`max_open_agent_prs`, `merge_budget_per_day`), which repositories and work-source bands the fleet is pointed at, how far up D18's ladder it has climbed, and which defect to fix next. Choosing among them needs three **exhaustive** accounts, each carrying an invariant that makes it trustworthy rather than merely plausible: **time** — every node-second in a window falls into exactly one state (producing, overhead, externally blocked, idle with demand, idle without demand, down), and the states sum to node-count × window; **spend** — every token and dollar is attributed either to one work item's fate or to a named overhead class, and those sum to the roll-up total; **flow** — every work item carries a lifecycle from first sighting to terminal fate, and items entering equals items leaving plus work in progress. A second, a token or an item that cannot be classified lands in an explicit `unaccounted` bucket and is never dropped: an account that silently loses its remainder can be glanced at but not reasoned from. Analytics is a **separate surface** from operations — "is it broken now" and "am I getting value, and what should I change" are different questions, with different windows, audiences and refresh rates, and today's dashboard mixes them — and it needs history the transcripts do not have: `log.jsonl` and `review-log.jsonl` are excluded from `scripts/rotate-logs.sh`'s size-based rotation (requirement 2.6), so every rate the dashboard states over them is bounded only by how far back this pipeline's own logging began, which is why the Co-Ordinator verdict-quality panel states `window_from`/`window_to` beneath its own figures rather than assuming complete history. The analytics records are small, structured and append-only, so they carry an explicit retention policy of their own, `analytics_retained_days` (requirement 2.6d) — `0` by default, meaning indefinitely, today's behaviour — independent of the pruning that bounds per-cycle transcripts under `cycles/`/`reviews/` (requirement 2.5). Their production is priced under D14 like everything else: agent containers emit facts, the analytics container does the arithmetic. |
| D22 | Evidence-driven model selection | **Models are graded on what their runs produced, not on what they did; comparisons are stratified or not made; and an installation can run controlled trials to get comparable evidence.** Decided August 2026. Per-actor model choice (D12) is the largest single lever on both of D21's rates, and it is chosen today by reputation and revised by anecdote. Grading on activity — how often each model ran, how many turns it took, what it cost — describes the fleet without informing the choice; what informs the choice is outcome: whether the Implementer's pull request landed unchanged, whether it needed a second pass, whether the Reviewer's findings held up, whether the Co-Ordinator's pick survived corroboration, and at what cost and latency per landed item. Two disciplines keep such a comparison honest. **Stratify or abstain:** models are assigned by tier and the tiers see systematically different work, so an unstratified ranking compares hard items against easy ones and will confidently recommend the wrong model; every comparison states its strata and its sample size, and shows "insufficient evidence" rather than a spurious ordering below a stated minimum. **Trial deliberately:** observational data alone cannot separate a model from the work it happened to be given, so the product supports an opt-in **model trial** — a candidate takes a configured share of one actor's eligible work for a bounded period or item count, the arm is recorded on the item, and the comparison is then between arms rather than between eras. A trial is opt-in per installation, capped by a stated cost budget, abortable at any moment, and never assigned to the critical tier unless that is separately opted into. What it yields is a recommendation with an effect size, a sample and a confidence statement — or no recommendation at all — never a leaderboard. |
| D23 | Rework and escape accounting | **Rework is the pipeline's only honest quality signal and its largest recoverable waste, so it is counted by class, attributed to the stage that caused it, and priced — and never driven to zero.** Decided August 2026. A repetition spends both of D21's rates at once and produces nothing that did not already exist, which makes it the first place to look for either; it is also the only quality measure the product can make without asserting one, since code quality cannot be observed directly but a second attempt is a judgement already made — some actor, check or human found the first insufficient and said so. It is counted **by class**, because a single rework rate names no lever: review round-trips, human change requests after an agent had already flipped a pull request to ready, check failures on a raised pull request, merge conflicts, abandoned drafts resumed by a later cycle, re-runs of killed or crash-looped stages, work duplicated by a claim race, refinement bounce-backs, and post-merge reverts or follow-up fixes. Each has a detector already emitting today or a gap where one belongs, and each points at a different lever — a model, a prompt, a cap, the fleet size, or a product defect. It is attributed **to cause, not to performer**: a second Implementer pass spends Implementer tokens and may be the Refiner's fault for under-specifying, the Co-Ordinator's for picking something unworkable, the Reviewer's for passing a defect the human then caught, or the Implementer's own, and an account that skips this reports the Implementer as expensive when the finding is that items arrive under-specified. Cause is recorded from the detector that fired and the evidence it fired on, never inferred by a model after the fact. And it is **never a target of zero**: a Reviewer catching a defect is the system working, not failing. Detection has a cost ladder — agent review, then the landing gate at `human`, then a post-merge revert — that rises steeply at each rung, so the goal is moving detection *earlier*, and a panel reading "rework bad" would reward a Reviewer that waves work through, which is the most expensive failure the ladder has. The headline measures are therefore **escape rate per detection stage** — what share of defects got past this rung to the dearer one above it — alongside first-pass yield and rework's share of tokens and of elapsed time. One class is called out separately because it prices something other than a model: a merge conflict is `main` moving under a pull request that waited, so it measures landing latency, and it is retired by D17's queues and D18's ladder rather than by any change of model. |
| D24 | Untrusted-content containment | **Staged containment, with the residual named and accepted — never silently carried.** Decided August 2026 (review: `reviews/project-review-2026-08-23` F-SEC-01/R-01; register: `TD-PPagop-26082407`). The pipeline's defining act — reading work items from public repositories and acting on them with write credentials — is exposed to prompt injection by construction: any GitHub account can author text a stage reads verbatim, and prompt wording is not a technical control. Wholesale acceptance was considered and rejected: two of the three containments are cheap against what they buy, the exposure grows on this roadmap's own schedule (D11 makes the reference installation more findable with every phase), and an English-only barrier is exactly what D18 and D19 already refuse to trust elsewhere. The response is staged by price. **Now:** every prompt that embeds externally-sourced forge content (issue and pull-request bodies, comments, commit messages) frames it explicitly as untrusted data, never instructions — no behaviour change, effective against the naive majority of injection attempts, and the baseline any customer will demand of the product. **Next:** container egress allowlisted to the forge and the model provider's API — infrastructure-only, and it removes the arbitrary-host exfiltration and command-and-control channel outright; a compose-level change, so it reaches existing nodes by per-node delivery, never by an image roll. **At a trigger, not never:** per-stage tool scoping — the Reviewer and Approver first, read-heavy stages with no need of unrestricted bash — lands with the D6/D8 rewrite or ahead of the first non-Poetic installation, whichever comes first: per-stage capability declarations are product surface, and retrofitting them onto the stage-launch seam twice would pay the invasive cost twice. **Accepted permanently, eyes open:** the Implementer keeps broad tool access, because implementing is what it exists to do; and the forge itself remains an exfiltration channel in any design where the pipeline can write to public repositories. That residual is the price of the product category, and it is bounded by standing controls this acceptance depends on and therefore names: authoring credentials stay per-node, fine-grained, scoped to exactly the target repositories, and expiring (already `.env.example`'s stated rule); the Approver's power sits behind a separate short-lived App installation token (D18); branch protection, the D18 reconciliation gate, and `merge_autonomy_protected_paths` bound what any compromised stage can land; and the fleet's pause path and crash-loop detection bound how long a bad state runs. A later decision may tighten this — sandboxed stages, a credential broker; none may loosen it silently. |
| D25 | Forge authoring identity | **One GitHub App on the organisation, distinct from the Pullwright Approver, mints the pipeline's own authoring tokens.** Decided August 2026 (agent-ops#607). It fits the App machinery this installation already runs (D18 §5.3): short-lived installation tokens rather than a stored long-lived secret, no seat cost on any plan, and one auditable identity for the fleet's authoring — separate from the Approver so the authoring identity can never approve its own work, which a single shared App would recreate. The price accepted is that the installation's rate-limit budget and revocation are fleet-wide rather than per-node: one App per node would buy per-node budgets and per-node revocation, at the cost of a key and hourly minting per node, and that cost is not paid until the shared budget is *measured* to bind — a future measurement, not a guess about scale, is the trigger to revisit. The measurement exists (2026-08-30, agent-ops#1082/#1087): the fleet exhausted the shared per-user REST bucket in 10 distinct hours of 48 while the cycle-start gate, reading `GET /rate_limit`, fired zero times — that endpoint's body read cold is an empty window, not a reading; the gate now reads the `x-ratelimit-*` headers of a metered call, records a `github-budget` event per cycle and per stage, and `scripts/github-budget-report.sh` sums them. What the measurement buys is spent demand-side first, because the bucket is exhausted by polling unchanged state four times over: conditional REST reads (a `304` is free of the primary limit) and a per-call ledger through one `gh` shim on `PATH` (agent-ops#1084, the forge *transport* seam), the hot per-pull-request read-sets moved to the GraphQL pool that has sat idle since #312 (#1085), and one gather per fleet rather than one per node (#1086) — with this App provisioned (#1083) for isolation from the owner's own bucket. A per-node App is revisited only if the report still shows the bucket binding after those land. `GH_TOKEN` — the owner's personal access token — remains every node's degrade path: unset, unreadable or unreachable, the App's own identity falls back to it silently, so no node bricks over this identity being unprovisioned. The identity is resolved on demand, per call, rather than once for a cycle's whole life (agent-ops#1021, TD-PPagop-26082833): an installation token's ~1 h lifetime is routinely shorter than a cycle, so a `gh` transport shim on `PATH` and `git`'s own credential helper both mint through one resolver, immediately before each call, falling back to the ambient PAT under the same terms as before. This is the seam a D24 "credential broker" would later occupy, not that broker itself — no separate process, no policy, just where the mint happens. |
| D26 | Revenue model | **A paid tier exists on whichever delivery path Phase 4 chooses, keyed on entitlements rather than on the licence; hosting is the leading revenue hypothesis; free self-hosting stays for the segments that are the funnel rather than the revenue.** Decided August 2026. Until now monetisation was implied by the licence and deferred to Phase 4's "first paying customer", with nothing in between naming what that customer would buy. Three working models exist in this category, and all three run on public code: hosted-is-the-business with free self-hosting (Sentry, Plausible); open-core with a paid self-hosted tier (GitLab; n8n, which reached an estimated $40M ARR in 2025 under a fair-code licence — roughly 55% cloud, 30% enterprise licences, 15% embedded); and fully proprietary hosted products with funded distribution (Devin, Cursor, Copilot's coding agent). D2, D3 and D11 deliberately rule out the third shape, so the choice is between the first two — and the answer is both, because they do not conflict. **The tiers.** A free self-hosted tier — the whole suite, BYO keys, own use — for solo developers and open-source maintainers, who convert at low single digits and are worth more as distribution than as revenue. A paid self-hosted tier for small teams and mid-size organisations, keyed on the capabilities those buyers pay for and the free tier cannot have because they are expensive to build: the analytics surface (D21–D23) and the enterprise track (SSO, RBAC, audit trails) are the working hypothesis. And, if Phase 4 chooses SaaS, a hosted subscription that bundles the paid tier with the operating burden Phase 2 of this roadmap catalogues — provisioning, image rolls, credential renewal, configuration drift, derived-state repair. That burden is the product's own evidence that hosting is worth paying for, which is why hosting is the leading revenue hypothesis; it is tested with design partners in Phase 3 and does not close D2 early. **What it constrains now.** An entitlement — which tier an installation or tenant holds — is a first-class declaration in the control-plane skeleton (Phase 2), carried identically by a hosted tenant and a self-hosted installation so that neither path needs re-architecture, exactly as D4 designs in metering hooks ahead of usage resale; every paid capability is gated on it from the first one built, never retrofitted; and the both-paths rule holds, because entitlements serve both paths. Prices are not decided here: the pricing hypothesis is drafted in Phase 2, tested in Phase 3 and set at Phase 4 (GTM). What is decided is that there is a paid thing, what it is keyed on, and which segments it is sold to. |

## End state

What the finished product looks like, whichever delivery model Phase 4
chooses:

- Fully untethered from Poetic-Poems, which consumes it as an external tool
  like any other customer.
- Deployed via an orchestration tool (Kubernetes first), with autoscaling
  and scale-to-zero.
- Zero manual per-container steps: provisioning, credentials, and retirement
  are all non-interactive.
- Non-intrusive updates: a rollout never destroys in-progress work.
- Frugal by design: every container runs within stated CPU, memory, disk,
  and bandwidth budgets (D14), and components a node does not need — the
  dashboard first among them — are simply not deployed there.
- Deeply customisable: per-actor model selection (Co-Ordinator, Implementer
  at both tiers, Reviewer at both tiers, Enabler) from any supported
  provider — not only the Claude family — plus schedules, work sources,
  prompts, and repo conventions.
- Reviews scoped and instructed per repository (D7): the review pipeline
  reviews a repository, at whatever cadence the installation sets — neither
  "weekly" nor "project" is part of its name — and applies that repository's
  own review instructions and context, so an adopting repository's standards,
  deliberate conventions and out-of-scope areas shape its reviews without
  anyone forking the skill. A project spanning several repositories is
  reviewed as one subject, with the findings that only exist across a
  boundary routed to the repository that must act on them.
- Configured as code (D16): an installation's entire configuration —
  pipeline, orchestration layer, control plane — is versioned declaration
  applied by tooling; nothing is hand-mutated on a running node.
- Tech-debt management built in (D15): debt lives in the forge's issue
  tracker under a product-managed label, filed by any stage in one API
  call, worked down by the pipeline as an ordinary source, resolved by
  pull requests that write a structured record into `main`'s history,
  guarded on close, and mirrored append-only past the working store.
- Maintenance tooling delivered, never vendored (D20): a repository under
  Pullwright's care declares the capabilities it wants and receives the
  executables from the product. It holds its own data — its work items,
  its configuration — and none of the product's scripts, so a fix reaches every
  repository in every installation by upgrading the product, and no
  repository carries a drift check for tooling it does not own.
- Rendered previews verified (D19): every web-facing change is checked at
  the tier it needs — deployed, served, or fully rendered in a browser —
  with the browser living in one shared renderer per installation, never
  in the agent images, and a local build-and-serve fallback for
  repositories with no preview deployment at all.
- Productivity measured rather than asserted (D21): an installation can see,
  over any window, where its wall-clock went, where its tokens went, and what
  each work item did between first sighting and terminal fate — each as an
  account that adds up — and the product names the constraint currently
  limiting throughput instead of leaving an operator to infer it from a wall
  of counters.
- Models chosen on evidence (D22): every actor's model is backed by outcome
  data over comparable work, and a customer can trial a candidate against the
  incumbent on a share of real items rather than switching on reputation and
  hoping.
- Rework counted, attributed and priced (D23): an installation can see how
  much of its elapsed time and its token spend went into doing work a second
  time, which class of repetition it was, which stage caused it as against
  which stage performed it, and how far up the detection cost ladder each
  defect got before something caught it.
- Several supported hosting options.
- Source-available under FSL (D5), under a marketable product name, with a
  paid tier on whichever delivery path Phase 4 chooses (D26): an
  entitlement is one declaration carried by a hosted tenant and a
  self-hosted installation alike, the free self-hosted tier is the whole
  suite for own use, and the paid capabilities are the ones a buyer pays
  for because they are expensive to build.

## Pillars

Three properties the product is built to have, stated in the order a
conflict between them is settled. Decided August 2026. They compress the
decisions table rather than add to it: every rule below is already in force
in some decision row, and the section's job is to make the ordering
explicit instead of re-derived in each decision. A pillar earns its place
by two tests — it can be **measured**, or it is a claim; and there is
something the product **refuses** in its name, or it is decoration — so
each carries a definition, the measure that holds it to account, the
decisions that cash it out, and its refusal. Every decision that describes
the *product* serves at least one pillar; decisions about the *programme* —
how it is built, sequenced, shipped and sold (D1, D2, D6, D8, D10, D11,
D13, D26) — serve none and need not.

**Order: Quality, Autonomy, Efficiency.** Autonomy is the promise, quality
is the licence to deliver it, and efficiency is its price. Quality bounds
the other two absolutely: nothing buys autonomy or efficiency with it —
D18's ladder climbs on quality evidence and cannot simply be switched on,
and D23 refuses to buy efficiency by driving rework to zero. Autonomy and
efficiency trade against each other only knowingly, under the
calculated-trade-off rule (Principle 6): the product may spend tokens to
keep a human out of the loop, or call the human back in to save them, and
the change that makes the trade says so. The order is the mnemonic; there
is no acronym. The word is *autonomy* — self-government under rules the
installation sets and can tighten at any moment — never a synonym that
connotes acting without consent, which in a product whose defining act is
holding write credentials while reading untrusted text (D24) is exactly the
fear the `human` default exists to defuse.

**Binding rule: every pillar has a measure, and every measure has a
lever.** The lever rule (Principle 7) applies to the pillars first. The
measurement decisions — D21 (time, spend and flow accounts), D22
(evidence-driven model selection) and D23 (rework and escape accounting) —
are the backbone that makes all three pillars observable, and belong to
that role rather than to any one pillar. A pillar the product cannot show a
number for is a claim any product in the category can make; the number is
what makes it Pullwright's.

### 1. Quality

- **Definition.** Two faces. *What it ships:* the pull requests it raises
  are mergeable as raised — correct, reviewed to the repository's own
  standards (D7), and free of the defects each rung of the detection
  ladder above them would otherwise have to catch — the security of the
  emitted code included. *How it behaves:* the pipeline's own conduct is
  safe to run against a repository with write credentials — untrusted
  content contained (D24), the authoring identity never approving its own
  work (D25), the Approver's power behind a separate short-lived token
  (D18), and a human veto that outlives every gate. The second face is the
  one a mid-size organisation's security review asks about (D3), and the
  one a customer has to trust before the first face can be observed at all.
- **Measure.** Code quality cannot be observed directly; rework can (D23).
  The headline is therefore the **escape rate per detection stage** — the
  share of defects that got past each rung of the detection cost ladder
  (agent review, then the landing gate, then post-merge revert) — with
  first-pass yield beside it. For conduct: which of D24's staged
  containments is in force, and how many of the standing controls that
  staging names are verified rather than assumed.
- **Decisions.** D7 (the whole suite; reviews feed the pipeline the work
  it does), D15 (tech-debt management in the offering), D17 (merge queues
  retire the behind-but-green class), D19 (rendered previews), D23
  (rework and escape accounting), D24 (untrusted-content containment),
  D25 (forge authoring identity); Principle 5 (specs as-built).
- **Refusal.** Rework is never driven to zero (D23). A Reviewer catching a
  defect is the system working; a panel that rewards waving work through
  is the most expensive failure the ladder has.

### 2. Autonomy

- **Definition.** The pipeline is as autonomous as the installation wants
  and no more — up to a rung where the human supplies vision-level
  guidance and the pipeline works out the rest. The resource it conserves
  is human attention: every rung climbed is a class of decision the human
  no longer makes. It is opt-in per installation and per repository,
  climbed on that installation's own evidence, and at every level the
  default is the one that asks (D18: `human`).

  Autonomy has two axes, and only one has a ladder today. The **landing**
  axis — who approves and lands a pull request — is D18's. The **intake**
  axis — who decides what gets built — has rungs the product already
  partly occupies without naming them: human-written issues; work the
  product files for itself (repository-review findings, D7; stage-filed
  debt, D15); roadmap items decomposed from an owner's *[interactive]*
  moves (Principle 3); and, at the top, a vision the pipeline decomposes
  itself. The intake axis has no ladder, no evidence gate and no stated
  default, and this pillar names that gap (open question below): a
  Co-Ordinator inventing acceptance criteria for a trimmed work order, or a
  cheaper model authoring the specification a dearer one then follows, are
  intake-side failures with no rung to gate them.
- **Measure.** The `merge_autonomy` rung reached per repository and the
  evidence it was climbed on; `merge_budget_per_day` as the spend
  governor; and, once D21's accounts exist, **human attention per
  delivered unit** — human acts (approvals, change requests, hand-backs,
  escalations) per landed item. That figure should fall as the rung rises;
  a rung it does not fall for was climbed on paper.
- **Decisions.** D18 (the merge-autonomy ladder), D9 (mixed build mode:
  the fleet works down whatever can be decomposed), D20 (tooling delivered
  — a repository's autonomy from its own maintenance), D3 (the segments
  for whom attention is the scarce resource); Principles 3 (dogfood), 4
  (customer zero) and 8 (autonomy parity).
- **Refusal.** Nothing a customer has not opted into ever lands a pull
  request (D18), and a human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` blocks landing at every
  level. The veto outlives the gate.

### 3. Efficiency

- **Definition.** The product's own consumption per unit of delivered
  work: tokens, elapsed time, and the per-container CPU, memory, disk and
  bandwidth budgets of D14. It is distinct from autonomy by what it
  counts — efficiency counts what the product spends, autonomy counts what
  the human spends. Under BYO keys (D4) the token bill is the customer's
  own invoice rather than the product's margin, which makes this pillar a
  promise to the customer before it is a cost control for the vendor;
  under hosting (D26) it is both. Within the pillar D14 already orders the
  halves: resource budgets are held alongside, never at the expense of,
  speed of delivery.
- **Measure.** D21's two rates, verbatim — **delivered work per elapsed
  hour** and **delivered work per token** — each backed by an exhaustive
  account (time, spend, flow) whose remainder lands in `unaccounted` and
  is never dropped; D14's per-container budgets as the floor beneath them.
- **Decisions.** D14 (per-container efficiency), D21 (productivity
  analytics), D22 (evidence-driven model selection — the largest single
  lever on both rates); Principles 6 (calculated trade-off) and 7 (lever).
- **Refusal.** No resource is spent without the change that spends it
  saying so (D14), and no figure is published without a lever (Principle
  7).

### What the pillars do not hold

D4 (BYO keys), D5 (source-available), D12 (any provider) and D16
(configuration as code) form a cluster — the customer's keys, models,
configuration and readable code stay in the customer's hands — that is the
customer's autonomy from the *vendor*, not the pipeline's from the human.
Folding it into the Autonomy pillar would conflate two directions under one
word. It is recorded instead as a standing constraint, the customer-control
rule (Principle 9), in the both-paths rule's shape: a rule about what no
work may do, not a property the product is measured on. Three pillars are
kept because a triad is what a reader retains; a fourth would be paid for
in all three.

## Principles

1. **Both-paths rule.** Until the Phase 4 delivery gate, no work may assume
   self-hosted or SaaS exclusively. Anything that would (e.g. building
   usage resale, which only makes sense hosted) waits for the gate.
2. **Strangler rule.** No big-bang rewrite, ever. New surface in the new
   language; the bash engine earns its retirement one touched piece at a
   time.
3. **Dogfood rule.** Decomposable roadmap work is authored as
   agent-workable GitHub issues, labelled `roadmap`, in the repository the
   work belongs to — and the fleet implements them through its ordinary
   `issues` source. Items marked *[fleet]* below are intended for this path;
   *[interactive]* items are architectural moves done in sessions.
4. **Customer-zero rule.** Poetic's installation is never special. If
   Poetic needs anything that is not configuration, the product is not
   generic enough — that is a product bug, not a Poetic quirk.
5. **Specs stay as-built.** The existing spec discipline continues
   unchanged through every phase; the roadmap never substitutes for it.
6. **Calculated-trade-off rule (D14).** Resource cost — CPU, memory, disk,
   bandwidth — is a tracked property of every container, not an emergent
   one. Work may spend resources to buy quality or speed of delivery, but
   the trade is made knowingly and stated in the change that makes it.
7. **Lever rule (D21).** Every figure the product publishes names the
   decision it informs and, where the evidence supports one, the change it
   recommends and the effect that change is expected to have — otherwise it
   says "no action indicated" or "insufficient evidence" in as many words. A
   panel that is accurate, carefully bounded, honest about its window and
   still cannot tell a reader what to do differently is not finished. The
   Co-Ordinator verdict-quality panel is the worked counter-example, and it
   is superseded rather than extended.
8. **Autonomy-parity rule (D18).** No repository the product is developed in
   sits below the `merge_autonomy` level agent-ops has reached. A fresh
   repository defaults to `human` and climbs the ladder on its own evidence
   (§6's stage table) — that is the right behaviour for a customer's
   repository, whose safety evidence has not yet been mined. It is the wrong
   behaviour for a repository the pipeline's own code lives in: the evidence
   the ladder gates on is evidence about the pipeline's mechanism, already
   mined once on agent-ops, and re-mining it a second time on the product's
   own home would gate the pipeline's development behind a slower rung than
   the tool it produces has already cleared — the customer-zero rule's own
   bug case. `docs/PULLWRIGHT-DAY-ONE-AUTONOMY.md` is the provisioning
   checklist this rule cashes out to for any repository created after the
   transfer (D8 as amended) — the consumer repository first; the product
   repository inherits agent-ops's level by being agent-ops.
9. **Customer-control rule.** Nothing the product does takes the
   customer's keys, models, configuration or code out of the customer's
   hands: model usage runs on the customer's own key (D4), the source is
   readable (D5), every actor's model is the customer's choice from any
   supported provider (D12), and an installation's whole configuration is
   versioned declaration the customer applies (D16). This is the
   customer's autonomy from the vendor — a different direction from the
   Autonomy pillar's, the pipeline's from the human, and deliberately not
   folded into it (Pillars, above). It holds on the self-hosted path
   always and on every path until the Phase 4 gate, in the both-paths
   rule's shape: a capability that needs the product to hold what the
   customer could hold waits for the gate, where a hosted tenant may
   choose it and a self-hosted installation never has to.

## Phase 1 — Untether

**Goal:** the pipeline is adoptable by an arbitrary repository through
configuration alone.

**Entry:** now.

**Exit gate:** a repository outside Poetic-Poems runs the whole suite —
implementation cycle, review cycle, dashboard — from published artefacts
with no code changes; the product repository — agent-ops, transferred (D8) —
exists in the Pullwright organisation and carries its licence; Poetic's
configuration and deployment live in a repository of their own in
Poetic-Poems, with no pipeline code in it.

- [ ] Sweep the Poetic-specifics out of scripts, prompts, and config:
      hardcoded repo slugs, the owner's username, label names, branch
      conventions, and the poetic-fiddle implementation-plan source. Four are
      swept (the Enabler's assignee, the entrypoint's git identity, the
      implementation-plan path, the Co-Ordinator's repo/source table); the
      audit is done —
      [`docs/PHASE-1-POETIC-SPECIFICS-AUDIT.md`](PHASE-1-POETIC-SPECIFICS-AUDIT.md)
      inventories what is left across `prompts/`, `lib/`, `scripts/`,
      `deploy/` and `config.schema.json`, classified, with one follow-up
      issue per hit that needs a config key or a generic default (#585,
      #586, #653–#657). *[fleet — one item per specific]*
- [x] Parameterise the operating prompts so an installation can extend or
      override them without forking the product (`prompt_overrides` in
      `config.json`, docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md requirement 4a).
      Installation-wide per stage, not yet scoped per repo — see the item
      below. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Scope prompt overrides per repository, not just per installation. The
      Co-Ordinator runs once per cycle across every configured repo together,
      so a per-repo selection prompt needs that invocation split first; the
      Implementer and Reviewer stages already run against a single known repo
      and could take a per-repo override without it. *[fleet]*
- [x] Give a review its repository's own instructions and context (D7,
      issue #589). A Reviewer-Agent used to launch with five facts — `repo`,
      `default_branch`, `review_date`, `branch`, `pr_label` — plus the
      shipped `prompts/project-reviewer.md` and the injected `project-review`
      skill, identical for every repository. Two further keys,
      `project_review.defaults`/`repos[]`' `review_instructions` and
      `review_context`, hold installation-supplied text (how to review this
      repository, and what it is for), resolved on the same requirement-342
      rule as the rest of `project_review` and appended to the
      Reviewer-Agent's runtime input as `instructions`/`context`, each entry
      naming its own origin; `repo_context_file` additionally admits one file
      read from the repository under review's own clone, but only into
      `context`. **The trust boundary is decided, not open**: configuration
      wins and layers with repository-held text, which is admissible as
      context only, never as instruction — text a reviewed repository's
      contributors can edit is trustworthy only as far as a pull request
      into that repository is (D19's own reasoning), so anything that
      changes how strictly a review judges lives in the installation's
      configuration alone. `review-stage-start` records every resolved
      source and a digest of its text, so a review's inputs are
      reconstructable (`docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` R1c, R5 step 2a).
      This is the review pipeline's counterpart to the per-repo
      prompt-override item above; the two remain separate mechanisms — the
      per-repo prompt-override item is still open and may yet reuse this
      one's resolver. *[fleet]*
- [x] Config schema with validation and a `doctor` command that checks an
      installation end to end — the skeleton: `config.schema.json` (every key,
      its type, its constraints, and the value the code falls back to),
      `lib/config-schema.sh`, and `scripts/doctor.sh` over config, cross-key
      rules, models, prompts, toolchain, directories and GitHub access
      (requirement 1b). *[interactive]*
- [x] Make the schema the startup gate: `agent-cycle.sh` and
      `review-cycle.sh` validate `config.json` against it before any
      individual key is read, and the two guards it wholly subsumed
      (`nice`'s range, `prompt_overrides`' shape) are retired in favour of it
      (requirement 1b, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`). *[fleet]*
- [x] Make the schema the *only* source of truth rather than a third one
      beside the two prose tables: every reader takes its defaults from
      `config_defaults` (`lib/config-schema.sh`) instead of repeating a
      `// literal` of its own (#197), and the README and spec tables are
      generated from the schema's descriptions
      (`scripts/render-config-table.sh`, #198). *[fleet]*
- [x] Make schedules configuration-driven (per-pipeline cadence in config,
      not a baked crontab) — the `schedule` block, rendered by
      `deploy/docker/render-crontab.sh`. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Retire the cadence — and the false scope — from each pipeline's
      identity (D7): "hourly" and "weekly" must disappear from spec titles,
      documentation, prompts, and code, and every timing derived from the
      period today (lock staleness, retention counts, stand-down probing)
      must follow the configured value instead of assuming an hour. The
      review pipeline sheds "project" in the same sweep — it reviews a
      repository, so it is the repository-review pipeline — and the
      identifiers that say otherwise go with it: the `project_review` config
      block, the `project-review` pull-request label and work source, the
      vendored skill's own name. Each of those is a breaking change for an
      existing installation (a config key renamed, a label relabelled on live
      pull requests), so each travels with its migration note; the prose
      rename does not wait on them. **Done:** the prose sweep (#590) — spec
      titles, documentation, prompts and code comments no longer present
      "hourly" or "weekly" as identity, and the review pipeline is the
      repository-review pipeline throughout. **Remaining:** every
      cadence-derived timing's actual behaviour still assumes an hour rather
      than reading the configured interval (#591), and the identifiers still
      carry the old names (#592). *[fleet]*
- [ ] First-class non-interactive auth: Anthropic API key, Bedrock, and
      Vertex as the primary path; subscription OAuth documented as the
      supported self-hosted alternative (D4). *[interactive]*
- [x] Formalise the metering schema: per-cycle, per-stage token and cost
      accounting as a stable, documented format — `docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md`,
      the contract both pipelines and the dashboard are held to. *[fleet]*
- [x] Provider-qualified model identifiers in the config schema, so models
      from other providers can arrive later without a breaking change
      (D12). *[fleet]*
- [ ] Make the spend data say *what* the money bought, before anything is
      built on it (D21). Two defects stand between today's metering and any
      productivity figure — a third, the model dimension, is already fixed
      (issue #536): `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh`'s cost scan now reads each
      `modelUsage` entry's own `costUSD` rather than crediting a transcript's
      whole `total_cost_usd` to whichever model `keys` sorted first, and
      summing those entries reproduces `total_cost_usd` to the cent.
      **The item dimension is absent:** `cost_rows[]` is
      `{day, model, actor, usd}`, so "what did we spend on work that never
      landed" cannot be asked at all — though the scan already holds the cycle
      id it discards (`$cid`, the same string it slices `day` and `ts` out of)
      and that cycle's own record already names its repo, item, source and
      outcome. **The token dimension is recorded and never read:**
      `lib/metering.sh` writes `tokens.input`, `tokens.output`,
      `tokens.cache_creation`, `tokens.cache_read` and
      `gaps.{n,p50,p95,p99,max}` onto every `stage-end`, and neither the
      Publisher nor the page reads one of them, so the prompt-cache
      economics and the stall profile the pipeline already pays to measure are
      invisible. Carry `{repo, item, source, cycle, outcome}` on each cost
      row, and surface the token and gap series — both additive under the
      metering schema's own stability policy. *[fleet]*
- [x] Fix the flow-and-outcome event contract now, for the reason the metering
      schema was fixed now (D21): an analytic can only ever be computed from
      what was recorded while the work happened, so every month the contract
      is deferred is a month of history no later panel can reconstruct. Extend
      `docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md`, or a sibling under the same stability policy,
      to cover two event families neither pipeline emits today. **Item
      lifecycle** — one durable record per work item, accumulating instants
      that already exist as scattered facts (`first-seen`, refinement,
      `selection`, stage starts and ends, `pr-raised`, checks green, review
      verdict, `pr-ready`, landing, item closed); the **rework record**
      that exists nowhere (D23) — one entry per repetition, carrying its class
      (review round-trip, human change request after an agent flipped the pull
      request to ready, check failure on a raised pull request, merge
      conflict, resumed abandoned draft, re-run of a killed or crash-looped
      stage, work duplicated by a claim race, refinement bounce-back,
      post-merge revert or follow-up fix), the detector that fired and the
      evidence it fired on, and the stage the repetition is *attributed* to,
      which is frequently not the stage that performs it; and the item's
      terminal fate (`landed`, `voided`, `blocked`, `abandoned`, `superseded`,
      `open`). Recording the class and its evidence as the repetition happens
      is the whole of the difference between an account and a guess: a
      `CHANGES_REQUESTED` round and a re-run after a stage was killed both
      look like "two Implementer passes" to anything reading the transcripts
      afterwards, and they have nothing in common but the cost. Two
      scripts already compute halves of this offline and are the prototypes to
      generalise rather than duplicate: `scripts/pickup-metrics.sh` pairs
      `first-seen` with `selection` for pickup latency, and
      `scripts/mine-merge-history.sh` reports open→merge and ready→merge
      latency and the 48-hour revert-or-follow-up outcome per repository.
      **Node time state** — a transition event each time a node changes which
      of D21's six states it is in, carrying the cause, so that idleness is
      recorded with its reason at the moment it happens instead of being
      inferred afterwards from an absence of cycles. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Retain those records past the transcripts they were derived alongside
      (D21). `log.jsonl` and `review-log.jsonl` are already excluded from
      `scripts/rotate-logs.sh`'s size-based rotation (requirement 2.6), and
      requirement 2.6d states that exclusion as an explicit retention policy,
      `analytics_retained_days` — `0` by default, meaning indefinitely,
      today's unchanged behaviour — so every rate the dashboard states over
      them is bounded only by how far back this pipeline's own logging began,
      never by a rotation window; that is why the verdict-quality panel
      carries `window_from`/`window_to` and says so beneath its own figures.
      The lifecycle and time-state records are orders
      of magnitude smaller than the transcripts and are the only thing a trend
      or a model comparison can be computed over, so they get retention of
      their own, independent of transcript rotation — and a fleet in which
      several nodes publish the same union must not double-count them, the
      objection that made per-publish counters the wrong answer for the
      verdict panel. Where they are stored is an open question below, gated
      with Phase 2's state-store interface, which owes its caller *verify* and
      *rebuild-from-source* in any case. *[fleet]*
- [x] Read the served preview, not merely its status (D19, the *served*
      tier): extend `scripts/preview-deploy.sh` with a fetch mode that
      returns a chosen route's response headers and HTML through the
      deployment-protection bypass without the secret ever entering the
      transcript, and point the Implementer's and Reviewer's preview steps
      at the routes the diff touches — response headers included, which is
      the class poetic-fiddle#319 proved a status probe cannot catch.
      *[fleet]*
- [ ] Move the preview check behind per-repo configuration (D19): the
      Vercel specifics — one project per secret, the bypass header, the
      poetic-fiddle mention hardcoded into two prompts — become a `preview`
      block in `config.json` (provider, URL resolution, credential shape,
      or `none`), so an adopting repository declares its own arrangement
      instead of inheriting Poetic's. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Re-home agent-ops in the Pullwright organisation by transfer (D8 as
      amended; the name and org exist — D13). The repository — both
      pipelines, the dashboard, and the review skill
      `.claude/skills/project-review/` that `review-cycle.sh` stages into
      each clone at runtime, which stops being a pinned copy of a personal
      authoring repo and becomes product source (D7) — becomes the product
      repository in place, and its `merge_autonomy` level, Approver and D18
      evidence move with it: Principle 8 met by construction rather than by
      re-provisioning. Prerequisites, order and owner acts:
      `docs/PULLWRIGHT-REHOMING.md`, tracked by #912. *[interactive]*
- [ ] Extract Poetic's consumer configuration and deployment into a new
      repository in Poetic-Poems (a fresh name — the transfer retires the
      old one), leaving no pipeline code in it, and provision it per
      `docs/PULLWRIGHT-DAY-ONE-AUTONOMY.md`. *[interactive]*
- [ ] Retire the in-repo tech-debt registers in favour of labelled issues
      (D15, revised 2026-08-28): the managed `pw::type:tech-debt` label,
      the issue-backed `tech-debt` band, the filing and resolution
      conventions with their structured record block, the close-guard, the
      archive mirror, and one migration per repository converting each
      open register item into a labelled issue and freezing the register
      as history. Decomposed into `roadmap`-labelled issues per the
      Dogfood rule — the pull request that landed this revision lists the
      set. Retires with it: the canonical register tooling in
      `Poetic-Poems/poetic` with every consumer's drift-synced copies and
      `td-tooling-drift.yml`, the `td/<id>` reservation namespace, and the
      `register-hygiene` work source — deleting the largest entry from
      D20's delivery backlog. *[fleet, with owner-only acts flagged]*
- [ ] Apply the FSL-1.1-ALv2 licence to the product repository (D5), naming
      the licensor once the trademark search has cleared the name (GTM), and
      publish the licence reasoning — D5's — alongside it. *[interactive]*

## Phase 2 — Zero-touch fleet

**Goal:** nodes are provisioned, updated, and retired with no manual steps;
updates are non-intrusive; Kubernetes is a supported target; every
container has a stated resource budget it demonstrably runs within (D14).

**Entry:** Phase 1 exit gate passed.

**Exit gate:** a new node reaches its first successful cycle with zero
interactive steps; a rollout during a cycle results in a wound-down, completed,
or cleanly handed-off cycle — never a killed one; the suite runs on a
Kubernetes cluster from published manifests/chart; scale-to-zero is
demonstrated (no idle compute cost between ticks); per-container CPU,
memory, disk, and bandwidth budgets are stated and the metrics export
reports actuals against them; a node whose derived local state has been
corrupted returns to publishing without intervention, demonstrated by
injecting the fault rather than by waiting for it; and a node that fails to
converge on a rollout says so without anyone going to look, demonstrated the
same way; and the time account balances — every node-second in a stated window
classified into exactly one state, the states summing to node-count × window
with any remainder shown as `unaccounted`, demonstrated across a rollout and an
induced outage rather than only over a quiet afternoon.

- [ ] Graceful shutdown: a shutting-down node finishes or hands off its
      in-flight cycle before exiting. The auto-update case is already
      retired — watchtower's pre-update hook defers a roll while a cycle
      holds either lock — but that only covers the roll. A graceful shutdown
      covers every other way a container goes away: a manual `up -d`,
      `restart`, `down`, a host reboot, an evicted pod. Distinct from
      `--drain` (agent-ops#865, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`
      requirement 2.3d): this item is one node finishing its own one
      in-flight cycle at shutdown, with no operator action and no effect on
      intake; `--drain` is an operator-issued, node- or fleet-wide mode that
      keeps running many cycles — refusing only new intake — until every
      repo's finishing-source backlog is clear, and rests there rather than
      exiting. *[interactive]*
- [x] Secrets-based provisioning: tokens and API keys arrive as
      secrets/environment, never via `exec` logins into a running
      container (agent-ops#607) — the sole exception is the Claude
      subscription OAuth login (D4), interactive per node by design.
      *[fleet]*
- [ ] Health, readiness, and liveness endpoints plus structured metrics
      export. Health has to mean *outbound* health and not merely local
      liveness: a node whose last state-sync push failed is unhealthy even
      though its cycles run, its logs look ordinary, and its own dashboard
      renders it green. The incident below is what fixes the definition —
      both laptop nodes reported themselves fresh for four days while
      publishing nothing, because every signal either of them emitted was
      one it also consumed.
      Health also has to mean *converged*: whether the node runs the version
      the installation intends, and whether whatever is meant to get it there
      is succeeding. On 2026-08-14 watchtower on poetic-vm-1 tried to create
      two replacement containers it had never stopped, hit a name collision,
      and logged `Session done Failed=2` on every poll thereafter while the
      node stayed on the previous image — through a fleet roll carrying the
      fix for an outage the other three nodes had already taken. It was
      cleared by recycling the node by hand, and would not have cleared
      otherwise: the retry repeats the operation that collides. Nothing
      raised it while it lasted. The node was healthy by every
      definition it had (cycles idle, locks clean, heartbeat current, its own
      dashboard rendering), and it surfaced only because a human ran
      `check-nodes.sh` and read the image line: `lib/image-drift.sh`
      deliberately tolerates `image_behind_grace_hours` of lag, since a roll
      waiting on a cycle in flight is normal and not an alarm. So the
      updater's verdict has to leave the updater. An update mechanism failing
      repeatedly is a reportable fact in its own right, ahead of and
      independent of the drift it eventually causes — the drift check is a
      backstop against the *symptom*, and it was never meant to be the only
      thing watching. *[fleet]*
- [ ] A host-side vantage for the facts no container can see. The runtime
      deliberately holds neither the Docker socket nor the updater's log —
      a design property since the agent-ops#603 postmortem — so today a
      host-only fact reaches the pipeline one of two ways: a human runs
      `scripts/check-node-compose.sh` and reads the result, or the Enabler
      files an escalation asking the owner to run the exact commands and
      paste the output back (the owner-only boundary's conditions 7 and 8,
      requirement 36a of the implementation spec). agent-ops#1099 is the
      worked example: deciding whether the watchtower Conflict noise had
      stopped after the roll-deferral fix required reading watchtower's own
      log, nothing in the fleet could ever read it, and the answer arrived
      only when escalation agent-ops#1157 put three commands in front of
      the owner at a terminal (2026-09-04). The escalation is the correct
      floor and carries into the product unchanged, whatever the
      orchestration target — but it should be the fallback, not the
      mechanism. The control plane is the component that runs where the
      runtime does not, so it should own a collector at the host vantage
      (Compose) or the cluster vantage (Kubernetes) that reads what the
      runtime cannot and republishes it where the pipeline already looks,
      turning this class of owner data-ask into an automated read. On
      Kubernetes it is the missing consumer of the reporting gap the
      deployment item below records — `ImagePullBackOff`, a stalled
      rollout, a silent CronJob; on Compose it is the productised form of
      `check-node-compose.sh` and the updater ledger. What it does not
      retire: conditions 7 and 8 themselves — a fact that exists only in
      someone's head, or behind an account the installation does not hold,
      stays an escalation however good the vantage. *[interactive]*
- [ ] Self-healing derived state: every local store that is a cache of
      something else — the state-sync mirror first among them, and the
      workspace clones — is integrity-checked before use and rebuilt from
      source when the check fails, instead of being trusted because it sits
      on a volume that survives restarts.
      On 2026-08-08 an unclean shutdown truncated ~20 loose git objects to
      zero bytes in each laptop node's `.agent-ops-state` mirror. The damage
      landed on a *peer's* remote-tracking ref, so `git push` could no longer
      compute what the remote already had, and both nodes silently stopped
      publishing for four days; `git gc` stayed wedged on the same objects,
      so nothing self-healed. The mirror is wholly derived — the node's own
      branch from `state_dir`, every other branch from the remote — so
      discarding and re-initialising it costs one fetch and no information,
      which is exactly why it should happen automatically rather than by
      hand. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Per-container resource budgets (D14): measure each container's
      baseline CPU, memory, disk, and bandwidth; set budgets from the
      measurements; and surface actuals-against-budget through the metrics
      export above, so an efficiency regression is as visible as a failed
      cycle. Kubernetes requests and limits then enforce what the budgets
      state — but the budgets, and the measurement, exist on Compose too.
      *[fleet]*
- [ ] Split the dashboard into its own container, deployed only where it is
      wanted: agent containers ship raw data — metering, heartbeats, cycle
      results — and the dashboard container assembles and serves the page.
      Today the Publisher runs on every node's cron whether or not anyone
      is looking; a node without the dashboard container stops paying that
      CPU and GitHub traffic. The suite stays whole (D7) — the dashboard
      just becomes separately deployable (D14) — and the raw-data feed
      never leaves the installation's private boundary. *[interactive]*
- [x] Account for every node-second, and name the idleness (D21). The fleet
      today can say a node is running or idle, and for a no-op tick whether it
      stood down or found the lock held (`noop_ticks.{standdown,skipped}`); it
      cannot say why a node that was idle stayed idle, which is the
      distinction "should I run more nodes, or fix something?" turns on.
      Classify each node-second into exactly one of: **producing** — a stage
      executing against a claimed item; **overhead** — cloning, gathering work
      sources, pushing, publishing, state-sync: busy, but not the work the
      customer asked for; **externally blocked** — usage-limit stand-down,
      forge rate limit, provider outage, operator disable, each already
      distinguishable from `limit-hit`, `disabled` and the `github_min_*`
      budget guards; **idle with demand** — eligible unclaimed work existed
      and this node did nothing, split by cause, because each cause has a
      different fix: waiting for the next cron firing (fixed by the
      event-driven-dispatch item below), the back-pressure cap bound (fixed by
      a larger cap, or a rung of D18's ladder), every eligible item already
      claimed by a peer (fixed by a *smaller* fleet, which costs no throughput
      and saves the idle spend), and the Co-Ordinator declining to select
      against a non-empty eligible set (fixed by a different
      `coordinator_model` — the same failure the verdict-quality panel
      reports, arriving here as the elapsed time it actually cost); **idle
      without demand** — nothing eligible anywhere, the healthy zero, and the
      state Kubernetes scale-to-zero should make free; and **down** — crashed,
      crash-looping, heartbeat stale, container unscheduled, or the
      wedged-updater signature of 2026-08-14. Demand at rest is the part that
      needs building: a gather runs per cycle, so a sleeping node records
      nothing about work that arrived while it slept. The observable proxy
      already exists — `first-seen`-to-`selection` latency, which
      `scripts/pickup-metrics.sh` computes and whose own header notes it can
      never resolve below one `cycle_interval_minutes`. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Export the analytics series alongside the health and liveness endpoints
      above, in the orchestrator's own idiom (D21): the time, spend and flow
      accounts as metrics and structured events a customer can point their own
      Prometheus or OpenTelemetry collector at — so an installation that
      already runs monitoring gets these numbers inside it without adopting
      the product's page, and Pullwright's own surface becomes one opinionated
      reader of a published contract rather than the only way to see the data.
      Kubernetes' own signals join the **down** bucket here rather than being
      left surfaced-but-unread: pod phase and restart counts, evictions,
      `ImagePullBackOff`, a rollout past its `progressDeadlineSeconds`, a
      CronJob that has stopped scheduling — exactly the reporting gap the
      Kubernetes item below records and does not itself close. The wire format
      is an open question with a Phase 2 gate. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Build the analytics surface as its own deployable, on the dashboard
      split's precedent (D21, D14). Operations answers "is it broken now" at
      heartbeat cadence for whoever is on the hook; analytics answers "am I
      getting value, and what should I change" over days and weeks for whoever
      pays. They are different questions with different refresh rates and
      different readers, they share one page today, and the arithmetic belongs
      where the dashboard split already puts assembly — in one container,
      never on every agent node's cron. *[interactive]*
- [x] State the constraint (D21). The analytics surface leads with one
      sentence — what is limiting throughput right now, over what share of the
      window, and what to do about it — computed from the time account above:
      the landing gate, the back-pressure cap, model capacity, node count,
      cron latency, or the pipeline's own defect rate. Everything else on the
      page exists to justify or refute that sentence. It is also the honest
      business case for levers the product already has: an installation whose
      gate binds for most of a week is told, in figures it can check, what a
      rung of D18's ladder or a higher `max_open_agent_prs` would buy it, and
      one whose fleet is mostly idle without demand is told to shrink rather
      than being sold more nodes. *[fleet]*
- [x] Actor and model scorecards, superseding the Co-Ordinator verdict-quality
      panel and subsuming #529 (D22, issue #610, `counts.actor_scorecards`,
      docs/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md). One card per actor and, within it, one
      row per model and tier, reporting outcomes rather than activity:
      attempts, and how many ended cleanly (no `kill_reason`, no contribution
      to a crash loop); what those attempts *produced* — landed unchanged,
      landed after N further passes, voided, abandoned; first-pass yield; cost
      and wall-clock per landed item; and each actor's own measure — the
      Reviewer's own escape rate (rework of class `human-change-request`/
      `post-merge-revert` against items reviewed); the Co-Ordinator's
      corroboration rate, the old panel folded in, alongside whether the items
      it picked went on to land; the Enabler's and Refiner's unblock and
      refinement success. Every row states its stratum and its sample size and
      declines to rank below the minimum (D22). #529's own delivery — the two
      "model used" pies for the Implementer and the Reviewer — is retired as
      redundant with this card's own per-model, per-tier rows, which is now
      where that ratio lives. *[fleet]*
- [x] Report rework by class, cause and escape (D23, issue #611). The
      pipeline already emitted every detector this needed and joined none of
      them: `attempt-failed` and `kill_reason` for a stage that had to be
      re-run, the review gate's own `CHANGES_REQUESTED` rounds, `claim-lost`
      contention for duplicated work, `abandoned_draft_after_hours` for a
      draft another cycle resumes, the `merge-conflicts` work source for a
      pull request `main` moved under, the refinement block for an item
      bounced back as under-specified, and `scripts/mine-merge-history.sh`'s
      48-hour revert-or-follow-up check for what escaped a merge — all now
      recorded as the rework record (requirement 47, `docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md`)
      before being joined into this panel. The gap this item once inherited
      (a human change request arriving as a plain comment, invisible to the
      review gate) closed separately, ahead of this one — agent-ops#533, PR
      #539 — and a narrower residual remains: the human-gate rung only
      catches what the reconciliation gate observes at the Reviewer's own
      ready handoff, and the Enabler's own handoff-recovery path shares that
      check but only warns, never records, on a dirty verdict there
      (`TD-PPagop-26082919`, stated on the panel's own face). The panel
      (`scripts/publish-dashboard.sh` + `lib/rework-panel.sh`) answers three
      questions and nothing else. **How much?** — rework's share of tokens and
      of elapsed time, against first-pass yield: the fraction of landed items
      carrying zero rework records attributed to a stage — narrower than "no
      repetition of any class", per issue #611's own refinement, since
      attribution and outcome severity are different axes. **Whose?**
      — repetitions grouped by the stage they are attributed to rather than
      the stage that performed them, which is what turns "the Implementer is
      expensive" into "items are arriving under-specified" and points the fix
      at the Refiner. **How far did it get?** — the escape ladder, one row per
      detection stage (agent review, the human gate, post-merge), each
      carrying what share of defects passed that rung and the measured cost of
      catching one at the next: this is the panel's actual quality-control
      output, and it is why the page never presents rework as a quantity
      to minimise. A rising escape rate at the agent-review rung alongside a
      falling catch count at that same row is the signature of a Reviewer
      that has started waving work through; the panel keeps the two figures
      separate rather than blending them into one score, which is what keeps
      that regression legible instead of reading as an improvement. Feeds the
      actor and model scorecards above: rework attributed to a stage is that
      stage's model's
      record, and it is the outcome half of D22's grading. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Price the fleet and the tokens (D21, D14). Two questions the accounts
      make answerable and nothing asks today. **Is this fleet the right
      size?** — per node, the items it landed that no peer would have taken,
      set against its idle-without-demand hours and its share of contended
      `claim-lost` events, which `scripts/pickup-metrics.sh` already counts as
      its duplicate-work measure; a fleet whose nodes mostly lose claims to
      each other is over-provisioned, and shrinking it raises work-per-token
      at no cost in elapsed time. **Where do the tokens go?** — the spend
      account split by fate (delivered, rework, discarded, overhead,
      defect-driven), the prompt-cache ratio per stage and model from the
      `tokens.cache_read`/`cache_creation` series Phase 1 surfaces, and turns
      and stall profile per landed item from `num_turns` and `gaps`. A stage
      re-sending an uncached prompt every cycle, or a model taking three times
      the turns for the same diff, is a token-efficiency regression as
      concrete as a failed cycle, and is invisible today. *[fleet]*
- [ ] The renderer (D19, the *rendered* tier): one separately-deployable
      container per installation — the dashboard-split precedent — that
      takes a URL or a built static page, drives a headless browser, and
      returns screenshot, console log, and rendered DOM as artefacts to
      the requesting stage; agent images stay browser-free. On Compose an
      optional profile whose browser process exists only for the duration
      of a job; on Kubernetes an on-demand Job, so scale-to-zero holds. It
      alone holds the preview credentials, and it carries a stated resource
      budget (D14) like every other container. Rendered output is untrusted
      page content and reaches the model as data, never as instructions.
      *[interactive]*
- [ ] Local preview fallback (D19): where a repository has no preview
      deployment — agent-ops#424's dashboard is the motivating case — or
      will not share its build system's credentials, the renderer's builder
      side clones the pull-request head, runs the build-and-serve commands
      declared in the repo's `preview` block, and checks the result. The
      expensive path by construction, so it is opt-in per repo,
      concurrency-capped, cached between runs, and priced under D14; a
      static page needs no build step and costs almost nothing.
      *[interactive]*
- [x] Decide how the suite authenticates to the forge, so that no
      installation depends on a human's personal API quota. Every node, the
      Publisher, and every interactive session presents a personal access
      token belonging to the installation's owner, and GitHub keys the
      primary rate limit to the *user* and not the token — so extra PATs buy
      nothing, and the refusal names the person (`API rate limit already
      exceeded for user ID 2049303`, fleet-wide on 2026-08-12). #312 cut the
      cycles' GraphQL demand by ~97% and the dashboard split above removes
      most of what is left, but both are demand-side: one bucket of 5,000
      points per hour still has to cover an entire installation, however
      large it grows. Evaluate every available identity against demand
      measured *after* those two land, and record the arithmetic rather than
      the conclusion alone (D14) — the owner's PAT (status quo: 5,000 REST
      and 5,000 GraphQL points per hour per *user*, shared with their
      shell); one machine account per node (N × 5,000, but the Terms of
      Service permit "no more than one free machine account in addition to
      your free Personal Account", and on a paid organisation each is also a
      billable seat); one GitHub App installed on the organisation (seatless
      on every plan, but 5,000 points per hour *per installation*, rising by
      50/hour per repository above 20 and per member above 20 to a cap of
      12,500 — for a small organisation, isolation without extra capacity);
      one App per node against the same organisation (N × 5,000, still
      seatless, at the cost of a key per app and hourly installation-token
      minting that `gh` cannot do natively); and the Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN`
      (1,000/hour per repository and scoped to a workflow run, so rejected
      for a long-running node). Whatever ships as the default is what every
      adopter inherits, and a hosted delivery (D2) would have no option but
      an App, so this is a product decision and not merely an operational
      one — which means pricing it for Pullwright rather than for
      Poetic-Poems, because **the Pullwright repositories will not
      necessarily be public.** A Free organisation of public repositories,
      which is what Poetic-Poems is today, charges nothing for members and
      nothing for standard-runner minutes; that arithmetic makes several of
      these options look free when they are not free in general. Private
      repositories move the bill on both axes at once — Actions minutes
      begin drawing on the plan's allowance, and branch restrictions, the
      merge gate the whole pipeline is built around, reach private
      repositories only on GitHub Team or Enterprise Cloud — so a private
      product repository that needs the gate puts the organisation on a
      per-seat plan, which is precisely the plan on which machine accounts
      stop being free and Apps stay free. Evaluate under both organisation
      shapes and state which one the recommendation assumes. D18 adds a
      second criterion that rate-limit arithmetic cannot settle: any
      `merge_autonomy` level above `human` needs a non-author identity able
      to hold review and merge rights — GitHub refuses self-approval, and
      the pipeline authors as its owner. The Approver half is therefore
      decided ahead of the arithmetic here: one GitHub App per installation
      ("Pullwright Approver", `docs/reviews/2026-08-14-autonomy-investigation.md`
      §5.3). The authoring identity is decided too, on the same shape: one
      GitHub App on the organisation, distinct from the Approver (D25),
      seatless, and priced for a Pullwright organisation whose repositories
      may be private, with the fleet-wide shared rate-limit budget it costs
      accepted rather than paid down with a per-node App unless that budget
      is measured to bind. *[interactive]*
- [ ] Live within the shared bucket before buying more of it
      (agent-ops#1082). The 2026-08-30 measurement found the gate blind
      (#1087, fixed with the `github-budget` record) and the demand
      fourfold-redundant; the order is the demand side first, then the
      arithmetic: the forge authoring App provisioned on every node (#1083,
      owner acts, blocked by #1021/#1022); the transport seam — one `gh`
      shim on `PATH` with ETag-conditional REST reads, last-known-good under
      a refusal and a per-call ledger (#1084); the hot per-pull-request and
      per-repository read-sets on single GraphQL queries (#1085); the
      expensive sources gathered once per cycle for the selected repository
      only (#1086). Then re-read `scripts/github-budget-report.sh` over a
      week and decide the per-node App D25 reserved on that arithmetic, not
      before. *[interactive]*
- [ ] Climb the D18 merge-autonomy ladder on the Poetic fleet to
      `agent-merges-all`: Stage 0 evidence baseline and kill switch, Stage 1
      agent approval under the Approver App (human still merges), Stage 2
      autonomous landing for the routine tier on agent-ops, Stage 3
      fleet-wide, Stage 4 protected paths behind critical-tier review and a
      cool-off. Each promotion is a one-line IaC config PR the owner merges;
      exit criteria, prerequisites, and the work-item breakdown are in
      umbrella #402 and the investigation report. *[fleet]* with owner-only
      acts flagged (App creation, ruleset changes, stage promotions). This
      item's Phase 2 placement is deliberately overtaken: per #628, all D18
      prerequisite and preparation work proceeds now, ahead of the Phase 1
      exit gate — WI-1..WI-11 already landed during Phase 1 and Stage 2 was
      entered 2026-08-18 under a recorded waiver — and only the promotion
      acts themselves (raising a repository to a higher rung) stay gated by
      umbrella #402's own evidence bars, which is the ladder's own gating
      rather than a phase boundary.
- [ ] Event-driven dispatch: GitHub webhooks, or a lightweight poller on the
      state repo, wake an idle node when a source-relevant event lands,
      instead of leaving it to wait for the next cron firing. Staged behind
      finish-then-continue and the sub-hourly heartbeat, both of which
      shipped in #268, since shrinking the pickup interval further widens
      the concurrent-claim window those two already had to account for.
      Unblocked now that its prerequisite — WI-2's PR-level claim exclusion
      (#238) — closed 2026-08-09. Issue #248 stage 3, WI-12 of #236.
      *[fleet]*
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment: manifests or a Helm chart, with the scheduler
      as a CronJob so scale-to-zero falls out naturally; Compose remains a
      supported option. This retires one whole class of update failure by
      construction rather than by fixing it: watchtower updates imperatively
      — stop *this* named container, create its replacement under the same
      name — so a step that half-completes leaves a collision it then repeats
      forever, which is what wedged poetic-vm-1 on 2026-08-14. A rollout
      reconciles toward a declared state under generated names, so there is
      no name to collide and no single failed step to repeat. What it does
      *not* retire is the reporting gap recorded against the health item
      above: `ImagePullBackOff`, a rollout past its `progressDeadlineSeconds`
      and a CronJob that has stopped scheduling are all conditions Kubernetes
      exposes and none that anything here reads yet. Surfaced in an API is
      not the same as reported to an operator. *[interactive]*
- [ ] Make the deployment an artefact: a node's compose (or manifest) comes
      from a pinned, versioned release rather than a hand-fetched file, so
      configuration drift becomes a version comparison the heartbeat already
      carries — retiring the detection machinery of #131 (the self-mount,
      `lib/compose-drift.sh`, the deploy-reminder workflow) along with the
      manual `up -d` ritual it watches. *[interactive]*
- [ ] Begin the control-plane skeleton in the chosen language (D6): a
      config service/CLI wrapping the engine — the first strangler fig.
      *[interactive]*
- [ ] Entitlements in the control-plane skeleton (D26): the tier declaration
      an installation or tenant carries — identical on the self-hosted and
      hosted paths, verifiable offline by a self-hosted installation — and
      the single gate every paid capability checks, built before the first
      paid capability rather than retrofitted onto it; the counterpart of
      the metering hooks D4 designs in ahead of usage resale. *[interactive]*
- [ ] Deliver the repository tooling instead of vendoring it (D20): fix the
      surface by which a repository declares the maintenance capabilities it
      wants and receives their executables from the product, with the lint,
      format and drift-check helper class as the first delivered set — the
      tech-debt register tooling, once this item's founding case, retires
      outright under D15's 2026-08-28 revision, and its vendored copies,
      every `td-tooling-drift.yml`, and the upstream manifest go with that
      migration rather than waiting for this one. Then migrate customer
      zero and delete what the migration makes redundant: the remaining
      vendored script copies in agent-ops, poetic and poetic-fiddle. A
      capability the product delivers cannot drift from
      itself, so the checks that exist to notice drift go with it — a
      migration that leaves them standing has not finished. *[interactive]*
- [ ] Extract a state-store interface so the git-branch state-sync stays
      the default but alternatives (object store, database) can arrive
      later without re-architecture. A git repository (`agent-ops-state`)
      is an expensive way to replicate small, frequently-changing state —
      every sync is a fetch/push round-trip and the history only grows — so
      candidate replacements are weighed on measured bandwidth and disk
      cost (D14) as well as on scale. The interface owes its caller two
      operations the git implementation lacks today, *verify* and
      *rebuild-from-source*, so that self-healing is a property every
      backend must supply rather than a repair someone wrote once for this
      one. *[interactive]*

## Phase 3 — First external users

**Goal:** strangers can adopt the product self-served, and design partners
run it in anger.

**Entry:** Phase 2 exit gate passed; at least two design partners
committed (GTM workstream).

**Exit gate:** two to three design partners outside Poetic-Poems run the
suite on their own repositories, self-served from public documentation;
onboarding takes less than an evening; per-repo cost is visible on the
dashboard; at least one design partner has changed a model, a cap or a fleet
size on the strength of a figure the analytics surface put in front of them,
and the effect of that change is visible in the same surface; a feedback
channel exists and is producing roadmap items.

- [ ] Quickstart: one documented command sequence from clean machine to
      first cycle. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Public documentation site generated from the repo. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Multi-repo configuration UX reviewed against real partner setups.
      *[interactive]*
- [ ] Dashboard authentication story for remote and multi-user viewing
      (today's answer is "tailnet"; partners will need more). *[interactive]*
- [ ] Surface the Phase 1 metering as per-repo cost reporting in the
      dashboard. *[fleet]*
- [ ] Support channel and telemetry (opt-in, privacy-respecting) for
      failure patterns. *[interactive]*
- [ ] First non-Claude model provider supported end to end, chosen by
      design-partner demand (D12). *[interactive]*
- [ ] Preview adapters beyond Vercel — Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, a plain
      URL template over the forge's deployments API — chosen by
      design-partner demand (D19). *[fleet]*
- [ ] Controlled model trials, and the recommendation they feed (D22).
      Observational scorecards can only compare what happened to run; a trial
      assigns a candidate model a configured share of one actor's eligible
      work for a bounded period or item count, records the arm on the item,
      and compares arms within the same strata — opt-in, cost-capped,
      abortable, and off the critical tier unless that is separately opted
      into. What it produces is a recommendation carrying an effect size, a
      sample and a confidence statement, or no recommendation at all. Here
      rather than in Phase 2 because it needs the scorecards' definitions
      settled and enough item volume to conclude anything, and because design
      partners on different repositories are what show whether a
      recommendation generalises at all; the opt-in telemetry item above is
      the channel through which cross-installation comparison —
      "installations like yours run X for this actor" — could later be
      offered, inheriting that item's privacy stance rather than relaxing it.
      *[interactive]*
- [ ] Project-scoped review (D7), the deferred half of the naming fix: review
      the several repositories that deliver one product as a single subject,
      not one at a time. That means one report set for the project, the
      findings that exist only across a boundary — logic duplicated on both
      sides of a sync, a contract changed in the provider and not in its
      consumers, an interface a consumer is still a version behind on — and
      each recommendation routed to the repository that has to implement it,
      as a pull request into that repository. Poetic is the motivating case:
      the framework in `Poetic-Poems/poetic` and the repositories it syncs
      into are one product reviewed in halves today, and the vendored-tooling
      drift D20 exists to retire is precisely the class of finding a
      single-repository review cannot see. Deferred to here rather than
      Phase 1 because it needs repository review untethered first, and
      because it is a genuine cost step, priced under D14 before it is built —
      N repositories in one review multiply the context one agent must hold,
      and a report that spans repositories has a wider blast radius when it is
      wrong. The instructions-and-context facility gains a project level above
      its repository one; project membership is configuration, so a repository
      may be reviewed on its own, as part of a project, or both.
      *[interactive]*

## Phase 4 — Delivery decision and launch

**Entry gate (a decision, not a task):** with design-partner evidence in
hand, close D2 — self-hosted product, hosted SaaS, or both. This is the
point where the both-paths rule ends.

**Exit gate:** first paying customer.

Common to either path:

- [ ] Pricing set for the tiers D26 names (tested in Phase 3) and billing
      integration, including entitlement issuance for the paid self-hosted
      tier — a signed key or equivalent that the product verifies through
      Phase 2's seam.
- [ ] Launch positioning, landing page conversion, licence story published.

If SaaS is chosen, additionally:

- [ ] Multi-tenant control plane and tenant isolation.
- [ ] The deferred leg of D4: metered usage resale with margin, quotas,
      and abuse controls.

If mid-size-org demand shows, an enterprise track opens (SSO, RBAC, audit
trails) — demand-driven, never speculative.

## Go-to-market workstream (parallel, from Phase 1)

Deliberately lightweight — hours a week, not a phase of its own:

- **Name:** ~~shortlist, domain and trademark checks~~ — decided:
  **Pullwright** (D13), org created. Remaining: secure `pullwright.dev`
  (and `.io` if wanted) and a proper trademark search before the licence
  carries the name.
- **Positioning and landing page:** drafted during Phase 2, on the three
  pillars in their order — and each pillar stated with its mechanism,
  never as an adjective, because every product in the category claims the
  adjectives: autonomy as a trust ladder an installation climbs on its own
  evidence (D18), quality as an escape rate the customer can read (D23),
  efficiency as accounts that add up with a lever on every number (D21).
  Working hypothesis for the segments (D3), to be tested with design
  partners rather than assumed: the solo developer's first question is
  autonomy (attention returned); the maintainer's is efficiency and
  quality together (a key not burned, a queue not flooded); the mid-size
  organisation's is quality's conduct face (safe to hold our credentials,
  D24).
- **Design partners:** recruitment starts at the end of Phase 1 — two or
  three, drawn from the three target segments (D3); committed partners gate
  Phase 3 entry.
- **Pricing hypothesis:** the tiers D26 names, with hosting as the leading
  revenue hypothesis; drafted during Phase 2, tested with partners during
  Phase 3, set at Phase 4.
- **Licence communication:** publish the reasoning for source-available —
  D5 records it — alongside the licence itself, with the tier boundary
  (D26) stated in plain words next to it, so that nobody reads the licence
  as the price list.

## Open questions

Parked deliberately, each with a decide-by gate:

| Question | Decide by |
|---|---|
| Which capabilities sit in the paid tier (D26) — the analytics surface (D21–D23) and the enterprise track (SSO, RBAC, audit trails) are the working hypothesis — and whether the tier boundary is the same on the hosted and self-hosted paths | Phase 2, with the pricing hypothesis; settled with design partners in Phase 3 |
| Entitlement mechanism for a self-hosted installation (D26) — a signed offline key, a periodic check against a licensing endpoint, or both — priced under D14 and against the air-gapped installations D3's mid-size segment may include | Phase 2, with the control-plane skeleton |
| Control-plane language (Go and TypeScript are the front-runners) | First control-plane commit, Phase 2 |
| Execution substrate for non-Claude providers — abstraction over agentic CLIs, a provider-neutral runtime, or an API gateway | Interface fixed with the control-plane skeleton, Phase 2; first non-Claude provider lands in Phase 3 |
| State store beyond git state-sync | Interface fixed in Phase 2; replacement whenever scale or measured resource cost (D14) demands |
| What a rendered verdict is (D19) — screenshots a model eyeballs, scripted assertions the repo declares, a visual diff against a baseline, or some blend | First renderer commit, Phase 2 |
| How tooling reaches a repository (D20) — a versioned package the repository pins, an image or action the pipeline mounts at cycle time, or product-managed synchronisation pull requests the repository merges. The choice is constrained by where the tooling has to run: some of it is CI (a repository's own workflow calling a product-supplied guard), some of it is an agent's shell mid-cycle | Interface fixed with the control-plane skeleton, Phase 2 |
| What counts as a unit of delivered work (D21's numerator) — merged pull requests, closed work items, or a size- or tier-weighted measure — and how a voided, superseded or human-abandoned item scores | Phase 2, with the first panel to state a rate |
| Where the lifecycle and time-state records live, and for how long (D21) — a table in the state store, a time-series database beside the analytics container, or the state repository itself — priced under D14 against the retention a year of trend needs | Phase 2, with the state-store interface |
| Wire format for the analytics export (D21) — Prometheus/OpenMetrics, OTLP, or the product's own JSON behind an adapter — and whether the analytics surface reads that export or the store behind it | Phase 2, with the control-plane skeleton |
| Whether a model trial may ever be assigned to the critical tier, and what evidence would justify allowing it (D22) | Phase 3, with the trial facility |
| How a repetition's cause is attributed (D23) — from the detector alone, from the diff between one pass and the next, or from the reviewing actor's own stated finding — and what is admissible when two causes are equally plausible, given that a model inferring cause after the fact is exactly what the decision forbids | Phase 2, with the rework panel |
| How long after a merge a revert or a follow-up fix still counts as an escape (D23) — `scripts/mine-merge-history.sh` uses 48 hours — and whether that window is the same for a repository merging once a week as for one merging hourly | Phase 2, with the rework panel |
| The intake ladder (Autonomy pillar) — what the rungs are between human-written issues and a vision the pipeline decomposes itself, what evidence gates each, what the default is, and whether the Refiner's tier is bound to the Implementer's as the first rung (`refinement_policy` is unset fleet-wide today and `refiner_model` is optional, so a cheaper model can author the specification a dearer one follows). Landing has a ladder (D18); intake has rungs the product occupies without naming them | Phase 2, alongside the D18 climb on the Poetic fleet; no installation is offered a rung above human-authored intake before Phase 3 |
| Multi-forge support — which forges beyond GitHub, in what order, and what the abstraction seam costs to retrofit. That the product gets one is not in question: a forge-abstraction layer, so an installation can point Pullwright at a forge other than GitHub, is intended (owner, 2026-08-29, agent-ops#942). **Which** forges it serves is deliberately not pre-decided and will follow user demand — GitLab, Bitbucket and Gitea name the category, not a shortlist, and no order among them is implied. Equally open is where the seam sits: the forge is reached today through `gh` invocations and GitHub-shaped concepts (issues, labels, pull requests, checks, merge queues, App installations) spread across the libraries, the stage prompts and the vendored skills, so the retrofit is a survey before it is a design. The *transport* half — a rate-limit-aware `gh` seam with conditional reads and a per-call ledger (agent-ops#1084) — is built ahead of it, because rate limits, ETags and retries are properties of every forge's transport rather than of GitHub's concepts: a slice the layer will consume, not a bring-forward of the layer, and it decides nothing about where the semantic seam sits | Post-MVP: revisit on design-partner demand from Phase 3, build no earlier than after the Phase 4 launch. Nothing before then waits on it |
| SaaS infrastructure | Only if Phase 4 chooses SaaS |

## Assumptions

- **An orchestrator does not make derived state safe.** Kubernetes improves
  *detection*: a sync modelled as its own CronJob fails as a first-class Job
  status rather than as a line in a log nobody reads, and graceful shutdown
  removes one of the triggers. It does not repair anything. A corrupt
  PersistentVolumeClaim survives every pod restart, eviction and
  rescheduling the platform can perform, so the failure recurs on each tick
  and the backoff merely re-runs it; and the mirror has to be persistent,
  because re-fetching ~600 MB per node per tick is precisely the bandwidth
  the budgets of D14 exist to prevent. Volume durability guarantees the
  bytes are still present, never that they are still valid. Recovery is
  application work on any platform, which is why it is a checklist item
  above and not a consequence of the deployment target.
- **GitHub is the only forge through launch**, and every surface built
  before then may assume it. That is a sequencing choice, not the
  product's permanent shape: the forge-abstraction layer is intended
  post-MVP (open question above), on design-partner demand. Until it
  exists, a surface that is GitHub-only states the limitation where its
  user meets it rather than implying a portability it does not have —
  the vendored `project-review` skill's tech-debt step is the worked
  example (agent-ops#942).
- The headless Claude CLI is the execution substrate for the Claude
  provider; the product's value is the orchestration, which is
  model-agnostic by design (D12). Non-Claude providers arrive behind the
  substrate abstraction, not by rewriting the engine per provider.
- The human merge is the default gate, and remains the only gate in every
  installation that has not deliberately configured otherwise: below
  `agent-merges-routine` on D18's ladder the product never auto-merges and
  never enqueues (D17). At or above that level, landing is a Script act
  behind D18's gates — and a human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` still blocks it at
  every level. The veto outlives the gate.
