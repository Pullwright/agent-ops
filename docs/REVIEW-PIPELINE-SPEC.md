# Repository-Review Pipeline — as-built specification

## About this document

This is the as-built requirements specification for the repository-review
pipeline — named for what each run does: one repository, on its own, with
its own clone, branch, report set and pull request. It is a companion to
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` (the implementation pipeline)
and `docs/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md` (the monitoring dashboard), and like them it
describes the system as it exists — any change to this pipeline lands
together with the edit that keeps this document accurate (see `CLAUDE.md`,
"As-built specifications").

**Where this document is silent, follow `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`.** The two
pipelines deliberately share their machinery — the lock discipline, the
minimal-`PATH` bootstrap for cron, usage-limit detection (`lib/limit-detect.sh`),
the JSON-Lines log format and `log_event` helper, the ephemeral-clone rule,
the stage launcher with its per-stage timeout, process-group kill and event
stream (`lib/stage-run.sh`'s `run_claude_stage`), and the
"straight-parse-else-last-fenced-```json```-block" result parser. This
pipeline **reuses** those, and must not reinvent them. References of the form
"requirement N" mean requirement N of `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`. The target
repositories' `AGENTS.md` files — or `CLAUDE.md`, for a repository that has
not migrated — remain binding on any agent working inside them.

## What it is

A second, independent pipeline that runs alongside the implementation
pipeline, on its own configured cadence
(`repository_review.defaults.min_days_between_reviews`). For each run it takes
one target repository and produces a full project review — via the vendored
`project-review` skill — against a fresh ephemeral clone, and leaves **one**
mergeable pull request carrying the review reports. Debt the review surfaces
is filed straight to GitHub as `pw::type:tech-debt`-labelled issues as the
review runs (R12), named under the pull request's `Defers:` section rather
than committed alongside it. A human merges the pull request. The filed
issues and the review's improvement prompts then feed the implementation
pipeline (and/or the `project-remediation` skill). The only human
involvement is merging the review pull request.

```
cron (repository_review.defaults.min_days_between_reviews; a daily tick with a
       skip-guard is recommended — see R4)
  └─ review-cycle.sh                  ← the Review Script: lock, stand-down, per-repo skip-guard
       └─ for each target repo, sequentially:
            ├─ ephemeral clone            ← fresh from GitHub, under workspace_root
            ├─ inject the vendored skill  ← into the clone, git-excluded (never committed)
            └─ Reviewer-Agent (Sonnet)    ← runs the skill, raises ONE review PR (ready)
                  └─ Human                ← reviews and merges (the only gate)
                        └─ feeds → implementation pipeline / project-remediation
```

## Relationship to the existing pipelines

- **Separate everything that must be separate:** its own Script
  (`review-cycle.sh`), its own cron entry, its own lock (`review-lock.json`),
  its own PR label (`project-review`). **Shared where sharing is correct:**
  `config.json`, `state_dir`, `workspace_root`, `lib/limit-detect.sh`,
  `lib/git-identity.sh`, the ephemeral-clone discipline, the `PATH`
  bootstrap, the `gh` transport shim that bootstrap resolves
  (`IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`'s requirement 2.0e — `review-cycle.sh`
  exports `PW_GH_STATE_DIR` once it resolves `state_dir`, so the shim finds
  this node's own state from every subprocess the review cycle forks,
  including its model-driven stage), and the result parser.
- **The review pipeline defers to the implementation pipeline.** If the
  implementation lock (`lock.json`) is held by a live process, the Review
  Script stands down and waits for the next tick — two heavy `claude` runs
  should not overlap, because they draw on the same subscription quota. This
  requires **no change to `agent-cycle.sh`**; the deference is entirely on the
  review side.
- **One shared quota signal.** A `limit-hit` event (requirement 10) is written
  to the *shared* `log.jsonl` with the *same* shape, so a usage-limit hit in
  either pipeline stands **both** down, and the dashboard shows it. All other
  review events go to the review pipeline's own stream (R16), so the
  dashboard's existing `log.jsonl` parser is unaffected.

## Actors

1. The **Review Cronjob** — the crontab entry that fires the Review Script.
2. The **Review Script** (`review-cycle.sh`) — a bash script that orchestrates
   one run across the target repositories, on its own configured cadence
   (`repository_review.defaults.min_days_between_reviews`). It launches the
   Reviewer-Agent; agents never launch the Script.
3. The **Reviewer-Agent** — a headless Claude Code invocation that runs the
   `project-review` skill against one ephemeral clone and raises one review
   pull request. One invocation per repository. It writes no comments today, so
   it stamps none of `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`'s requirement 9d
   headers itself; `dashboard/index.html`'s `ACTOR` map and
   `lib/pipeline-marker.sh`'s `pipeline_actor_label` both carry an entry for it
   anyway, under the token `project-reviewer` and the display name **Project
   Reviewer** — the name this document's own Actor entry differs from, kept
   here as *Reviewer-Agent* since that is what the rest of this document calls
   it throughout.
4. The **Human Reviewer** — merges the review pull request through the ordinary
   GitHub process, and decides how to action its recommendations. Not launched
   by any part of this system.

## Environment

Identical to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` ("Environment" and "Target
repositories"); not repeated here. The target repositories are the same as
that document's, currently `Poetic-Poems/poetic` and
`Poetic-Poems/poetic-fiddle`, and their shared conventions (protected `main`,
squash-merge so the PR title becomes the commit, Conventional Commits) bind
the Reviewer-Agent exactly as they bind the Implementer. Where a configured
repository still carries a per-item tech-debt register (`tech-debt/`), that
register is a frozen archive: no ID is allocated into it and no file is added
to it. The Reviewer-Agent only ever
reads it, to update an item it finds already resolved (R12) — new debt this
review surfaces is filed as a labelled GitHub issue instead, never into that
register.

One repository-specific fact worth noting: `poetic` already stores prior
reviews under `reviews/project-review-YYYY-MM-DD/`; `poetic-fiddle` does not
yet have a `reviews/` folder, and the skill will create one on its first run.

## The `project-review` skill (vendored)

The skill is **vendored** into this repository at
`.claude/skills/project-review/` — a pinned copy of the upstream skill at
`~/Code/claude-skills/skills/project-review` (upstream commit `2c8e18c`,
vendored 2026-07-19). Only the runtime surface is vendored: `SKILL.md` and
`references/` (the four reference documents the skill reads); the upstream
`evals/` directory is dev-only and is intentionally omitted.

Two decisions are deliberate:

- **Vendored, not relied on ambient.** The machine's globally-available
  `project-review` skill is a *symlink* into the authoring repo
  (`~/.claude/skills/project-review` → `~/Code/claude-skills/...`) — machine
  state outside this repository's version control. Vendoring a pinned copy
  makes the pipeline reproducible from `agent-ops` alone and immune to the
  authoring repo moving or changing under it. Re-sync the copy deliberately
  when you want a newer skill; treat upstream as the source and this copy as a
  pinned deployment, exactly as `poetic` vendors framework files into consumer
  repos.
- **In the orchestrator, not the product repos.** The review runs in an
  *ephemeral clone* of each product repo (the pipeline never touches the
  working copies under `~/Code`, and `main` is protected). So the skill must
  live with the orchestrator and be **staged into the clone at runtime**
  (R5b). Keeping it here — rather than committing it into `poetic` and
  `poetic-fiddle` — keeps the product repos clean, keeps the skill out of its
  own review's scope, and avoids opening a pull request into two protected
  product repositories merely to enable this pipeline.

## Configuration

One `repository_review` object in the existing `config.json` (one config file —
never a second one) holds every tunable for this pipeline, in two parts
(requirement 342): `defaults` — every tunable set once, installation-wide —
and `repos` — the repositories to review, each a `{"slug": "owner/name"}`
entry that may additionally carry any of `defaults`' own keys to override it
for that repository alone. The resolution rule is uniform: for repository *r*
and key *k*, the effective value is `repos[i][k]` when that key is present and
non-null on *r*'s own entry, and `defaults[k]` otherwise; an entry carrying
only `slug` inherits every default. `lock_stale_after` sits outside `defaults`
— it bounds the shared review lock, which covers whichever repositories a run
touches, not any one repository, so it has no per-repo override.

**`project_review` is a deprecated alias for `repository_review`**
(agent-ops#592, D7): the two are the identical shape, and `config_defaults`
resolves either spelling into `.repository_review` before any stage reads it,
so nothing downstream of that merge ever has to know the old spelling exists.
Setting both in the same `config.json` is a configuration error —
`config_schema_errors` refuses it, naming both keys — rather than a silent
precedence, since resolving one of two present keys by precedence is exactly
the quiet failure `config.schema.json`'s own validator exists to catch.
`scripts/doctor.sh` warns when `project_review` is the only one set, naming
`repository_review` as the replacement. There is no calendar-based
deprecation window for the old spelling: this installation has no release
train to express one in (`config.json` ships inside the image, so a node
never runs new code against an old config file of its own), and the only
compatibility window that genuinely exists is the fleet roll — **the old
spelling stops being accepted once every node in the fleet reports an image
containing the rename.**

### Review instructions and context

Three further keys, resolved on the same requirement-342 rule as every other
`defaults`/`repos[]` pair, give a review its repository's own instructions and
context (R1c, R5 step 2a; issue #589, D7 in `docs/ROADMAP.md`): what to weigh,
what to ignore, which standards apply, what the repository is for, its
domain, its relationships to other repositories, its consumers and
deployment. Before this, the Reviewer-Agent had only five facts
(`repo`, `default_branch`, `review_date`, `branch`, `pr_label`) plus the
shipped prompt and skill, identical for every repository — an installation
reviewing several repositories against different standards, or wanting a
generated or vendored directory held out of scope, had nowhere to say so
short of forking the skill.

**The decision, and the reasoning (D7's open question, now closed):** both
layered, **configuration winning**, with repository-held text admissible as
*context* only — never as *instruction*. `review_instructions` and
`review_context` hold installation-supplied text, resolved from `state_dir`
exactly like `prompt_overrides`' `extend` (requirement 4a); `repo_context_file`
additionally admits one file read from the repository under review's own
clone, but only into `context`. The reasoning is D19's: text a reviewed
repository's contributors can edit is trustworthy only as far as a pull
request into that repository is, so anything that changes how *strictly* a
review judges — instruction — must live in the installation's own
configuration, never in the repository being judged; a repository may still
describe *itself* (D20's rule that a repository holds its own data), and
that description reaches the Reviewer-Agent as attributed data, labelled
`source: "repository"`, never as an unattributed instruction
(`prompts/project-reviewer.md`'s own "Untrusted external content" section
states this boundary for the agent). Unlike a `prompt_overrides` path, which
a stage silently runs without when it does not resolve, a configured
`review_instructions`/`review_context` path that does not resolve is a
fail-fast config error (R1c) at cycle start and at `scripts/doctor.sh`,
because this text changes a review's verdict rather than a stage's general
guidance; `repo_context_file` is the opposite — legitimately absent for a
repository that has not opted in, so a missing file there is simply absent,
never a fault.

```json
"repository_review": {
  "defaults": {
    "review_instructions": ["review-instructions/poetic-fiddle.md"],
    "review_context": ["review-context/poetic-suite.md"],
    "repo_context_file": ".github/REVIEW-CONTEXT.md"
  }
}
```

Delivery: `review-cycle.sh` resolves every source for the repository about to
be reviewed and appends two fields to the Reviewer-Agent's runtime input
(R5 step 2a) — `instructions` and `context`, each an array of `{source,
origin, text, truncated, bytes, digest}` objects, `source` one of `"config"`
or `"repository"` and `origin` the configured or repository-relative path the
text came from. Each source is capped at a fixed size
(`REVIEW_CONTEXT_SOURCE_MAX_BYTES`, `lib/review-context.sh`), with `truncated`
set rather than the text silently trimmed without saying so. The
`review-stage-start` event (R7b) names every resolved source alongside a
sha256 digest of the text actually sent — `lib/review-context.sh`'s
`review_context_sources_digest` — so a past review's inputs are
reconstructable without the log carrying arbitrary file content.

The values below are the confirmed defaults; the README documents each key, and
`config.schema.json` carries them alongside the implementation pipeline's
(`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 1b) — one file, one
schema, so `scripts/doctor.sh` checks both pipelines' configuration in one
pass and neither half can drift while the other is checked. The object as a
whole is optional there: an installation that does not run reviews simply
leaves it out. `review-cycle.sh` therefore tests for the block against
`config.json` itself rather than against the merge `config_defaults` returns
(`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 1b): that merge
synthesises a `repository_review` object from the defaults of the leaves under
it, so it can never report the block absent, and this one check must read
absence as absence — against either spelling (`has("repository_review") or
has("project_review")`), since the deprecated alias above counts as
configuring the pipeline exactly as the current spelling does. Every key
*within* the block is read from the merge as everywhere else, which is what
lets it use `repository_review` unconditionally: `config_defaults` has
already folded whichever spelling `config.json` set into that key.

The body rows of the table below are generated from that schema — each key's
`x-docs.spec` prose and `x-docs.value` cell — by
`scripts/render-config-table.sh` (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`
component 16), between the `config-table` markers, and CI fails a pull
request that leaves them stale. Edit the schema, not the rows. A Notes cell
over 500 characters is capped, with its full text deferred to this document's
`config-table:notes id=review` region below the table; `not_before`'s note is
the one long enough for that today.

| Key | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `repository_review.lock_stale_after` | *(unset)* | A floor under the derived value, on the same terms as the implementation pipeline's `lock_stale_after` (requirement 4f). The derivation multiplies the widest Reviewer-Agent backstop by the number of repositories configured for review (floored at one, so a single-repository installation is unaffected), because one lock can span all of them reviewed back to back, and adds the same slack. |
| `repository_review.defaults.model` | `claude-sonnet-5` | The Reviewer-Agent's model — the lead that drives the skill. The skill itself delegates well-scoped sub-tasks to lower-cost subagents, so this is the only model to pin here. A deeper review can be dialled up to a higher-capability model without other changes. |
| `repository_review.defaults.pr_label` | `project-review` | Applied to every review PR. **Distinct** from the implementation pipeline's `autonomous-agent`, so review PRs never count against `max_open_agent_prs` and are trivially filterable. It must not be `obsolete`, for the reason given against the implementation `pr_label`. |
| `repository_review.defaults.branch_prefix` | `review/` | Branch name `review/<date>`, e.g. `review/2026-07-20`. A branch is already scoped to its repository, so no slug is needed. |
| `repository_review.defaults.timeout_review` | *(unset)* | An override for the Reviewer-Agent's backstop, on the same terms as `timeout_coordinator` and through the same derivation (requirement 4f). Absent is the normal case. |
| `repository_review.defaults.inactivity_review` | *(unset)* | An override for the watchdog threshold of requirement 4e, taking precedence over the derivation of requirement 4f. Absent is the normal case; `0` disables the watchdog and leaves the backstop as the only cap. |
| `repository_review.defaults.min_days_between_reviews` | `6` | The skip-guard threshold (R4). A repo reviewed within this many days is skipped. Six (not seven) leaves a day of slack, so a review that lands late one week is not pushed a full extra week the next. |
| `repository_review.defaults.min_prs_between_reviews` | `5` | The other half of the skip-guard threshold (R4). A repo with fewer than this many PRs merged into its default branch since its last review is skipped, independent of `min_days_between_reviews`. Absent everywhere, 5 is used — the fallback lives in code, not this default. |
| `repository_review.defaults.not_before` | *(unset)* | Optional. A timestamp before which no review may start (R3.3). Absent or empty means no stand-down; a value `date -d` cannot read stands the pipeline down rather than running through it. Expires by itself, which is why it exists rather than raising `min_days_between_reviews`: a threshold has to be put back by hand, and a cadence left quietly throttled is not noticed for weeks. As `defaults.not_before` it gates the whole cycle before the lock, exactly as a single...[continued below](#extended-notes-repository_reviewdefaultsnot_before) |
| `repository_review.defaults.report_directory` | *(unset)* | Optional. The report directory, as a GNU `date`(1) format string resolved with `date -u +"<format>"` relative to the repository root, for the run's own `review_date` (R4a). Absent, and absent on a repository's own override too, `reviews/project-review-%Y-%m-%d` is used — today's layout, unchanged; the fallback lives in code, not this default, so a schema-only reader sees it as genuinely unset. Must be day-granular (R4a): a format carrying `%H`, `%M` or `%S` resolves...[continued below](#extended-notes-repository_reviewdefaultsreport_directory) |
| `repository_review.defaults.review_instructions` | *(unset)* | Optional. Installation-held instructions (R5 step 2a), resolved against `state_dir` on the same terms as `prompt_overrides`' `extend` (requirement 4a). A configured path that does not resolve is a fail-fast config error (R1c) — never tolerated the way a `prompt_overrides` path is, because this text changes how strictly a review judges. The only instruction channel D7 admits; a repository under review has none. |
| `repository_review.defaults.review_context` | *(unset)* | Optional. Installation-held context (R5 step 2a), resolved exactly as `review_instructions` and equally fail-fast on a missing configured path (R1c). Layered with `repo_context_file` below rather than replacing it — both reach the Reviewer-Agent as `context`, each with its own origin stated. |
| `repository_review.defaults.repo_context_file` | *(unset)* | Optional. A repository-relative path read from the ephemeral clone (R5 step 2a) and added as `context`, attributed `source: "repository"`. Never treated as instruction (D7). Unset by default; absent from the clone is simply absent — never a fail-fast error, unlike `review_instructions`/`review_context`. |
| `repository_review.repos` | `[{"slug": "Poetic-Poems/poetic"}, {"slug": "Poetic-Poems/poetic-fiddle"}]` | The repositories to review. Each entry's `slug` is required; every other key overrides the same-named key in `defaults` for that repository alone (requirement 342), and an entry carrying only `slug` inherits every default. A review has no per-repo work-source structure beyond these overrides. Adding a repo is a config-only change. |
| `project_review` | *(unset)* | Deprecated alias for `repository_review` (agent-ops#592, D7): accepted with the identical shape while the fleet rolls onto an image containing the rename. `scripts/doctor.sh` warns when this is the only one set, naming `repository_review` as the replacement. Setting both is a configuration error (`config_schema_errors` refuses it, naming both keys) rather than a silent precedence, since resolving one of two present keys is exactly the quiet failure this schema exists to...[continued below](#extended-notes-project_review) |

Model IDs are pinned in config (one place to update); do not use floating
aliases in the launch command.

`repository_review.defaults.model` (or a repository's own override in
`repository_review.repos`, requirement 342) accepts a bare id
(`claude-sonnet-5`) or a provider-qualified one (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`),
resolved by the same `resolve_model_id` (`lib/model-id.sh`) the implementation
pipeline uses — see
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 1a. Anthropic is the only
executable provider (D12, `docs/ROADMAP.md`); a qualifier naming any other
provider is a fail-fast config error at cycle start, not a value passed to
`claude --model`.

#### Extended notes: `repository_review.defaults.not_before`

Optional. A timestamp before which no review may start (R3.3). Absent or empty means no stand-down; a value `date -d` cannot read stands the pipeline down rather than running through it. Expires by itself, which is why it exists rather than raising `min_days_between_reviews`: a threshold has to be put back by hand, and a cadence left quietly throttled is not noticed for weeks. As `defaults.not_before` it gates the whole cycle before the lock, exactly as a single installation-wide value always has; a repository's own override on `repos[]` is resolved separately, per repository, once the cycle is under way (requirement 3.3).

#### Extended notes: `repository_review.defaults.report_directory`

Optional. The report directory, as a GNU `date`(1) format string resolved with `date -u +"<format>"` relative to the repository root, for the run's own `review_date` (R4a). Absent, and absent on a repository's own override too, `reviews/project-review-%Y-%m-%d` is used — today's layout, unchanged; the fallback lives in code, not this default, so a schema-only reader sees it as genuinely unset. Must be day-granular (R4a): a format carrying `%H`, `%M` or `%S` resolves differently at discovery time than it did at write time, and discovery silently finds nothing.

#### Extended notes: `project_review`

Deprecated alias for `repository_review` (agent-ops#592, D7): accepted with the identical shape while the fleet rolls onto an image containing the rename. `scripts/doctor.sh` warns when this is the only one set, naming `repository_review` as the replacement. Setting both is a configuration error (`config_schema_errors` refuses it, naming both keys) rather than a silent precedence, since resolving one of two present keys is exactly the quiet failure this schema exists to catch.

## The Landing Gate and the loop it closes

The review pipeline raises **one pull request per repository, ready for
review** (not draft — the review *is* the deliverable, and there is no second
review stage to flip it). The PR is labelled with the repository's own
resolved `repository_review` pr_label (its override, or
`repository_review.defaults.pr_label`, requirement 342), titled in
Conventional Commits form (e.g. `docs(review): repository review 2026-07-20`),
and its body summarises the verdict and links the review index. A human
approves and merges it, at every `merge_autonomy` level: `review-cycle.sh`
engages no Approver stage, so the implementation pipeline's trust ladder
(`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` §The Landing Gate) does not yet
reach review pull requests, however the installation has configured it.
Review PRs join that ladder when an Approver is wired into this pipeline —
work no item covers yet, named here so the gap is a stated one rather than
a silent one.

The point of the pipeline is the *loop*, not the report. Debt the review
surfaces is filed straight to GitHub, as labelled issues, while the review
runs (R12) — not held for the pull request to land; once the pull request
merges, its `04-improvement-prompts.md` lands on `main` too, where:

- the **implementation pipeline's** Co-Ordinator can pick up any issue the
  review filed through its own `issues` work source; and/or
- the human runs the **`project-remediation`** skill (the review's
  counterpart) to work down the recommendations deliberately.

So the review is the *front* of a loop that ends in merged improvements,
each landed through whatever gate its repository's `merge_autonomy` level
sets — the human's own, at the default — never a dead-end document.

## Requirements

### The Review Script (`review-cycle.sh`)

R1. **Bootstrap.** Reuse the `PATH` bootstrap and binary checks of
   `agent-cycle.sh` verbatim (claude, gh, git, jq must resolve under cron's
   minimal environment). Source `lib/limit-detect.sh`. The script must pass
   `shellcheck`.

R1a. **Model id resolution (D12 groundwork).** Every configured repository's
   own resolved model (`repository_review.defaults.model`, or its own override in
   `repository_review.repos`, requirement 342) is resolved through
   `lib/model-id.sh`'s `resolve_model_id` immediately after `repository_review`'s
   settings are read and resolved, before the lock — the same helper and the
   same rule `agent-cycle.sh` applies to its own model keys
   (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 1a): a bare id means
   `anthropic/`, an `anthropic/`-qualified id has the qualifier stripped, and
   any other qualifier is a fail-fast config error naming the precise key the
   value came from — `repository_review.repos[i].model` for a repository's own
   override, `repository_review.defaults.model` when it does not have one — never
   the generic `repository_review.model`, so the error points at the exact key to
   fix (`lib/config-schema.sh`'s `config_repository_review_repos` resolves each
   repository's `model_key` alongside its `model` for this). Every configured
   repository's model is validated in this one sweep, before any repository is
   worked, so a bad model on one repository is never discovered only after
   others have already been reviewed.

R1b. **Duplicate-slug refusal.** Requirement 342's resolution rule assumes
   exactly one `repository_review.repos` entry per repository; two entries naming
   the same `slug` leave no way to say which one's overrides apply. Checked
   immediately after `repository_review_repos_json` is resolved, before the model
   sweep above: `lib/config-schema.sh`'s `config_duplicate_repository_review_slugs`
   — a third cross-key rule the schema itself cannot state, alongside
   `agent-cycle.sh`'s own two (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`
   requirement 1b) — names every slug appearing more than once, and the Script
   refuses to start naming them, exactly as `scripts/doctor.sh`'s own `fail`
   does against the same function, so the two can never drift on what counts
   as a fault. An empty `repository_review.repos` has nothing to duplicate and is
   not a fault.

R1c. **Review-instructions/context path validation (issue #589, D7).** Every
   configured repository's own resolved `review_instructions`/`review_context`
   entries (requirement 342) are validated up front, in the same sweep
   position as the model check above: `lib/review-context.sh`'s
   `review_context_missing_configured` resolves each path against `state_dir`
   (on the same terms as `prompt_overrides`' `extend`, requirement 4a) and
   names every one that is not a readable *regular file* — a directory is
   readable and would contribute an empty source rather than the text the
   operator configured, which is the same silent shortfall this check
   exists to refuse. Unlike a `prompt_overrides` path,
   which a stage silently runs without when it does not resolve, a broken
   entry here refuses to start the whole cycle, naming the exact repository,
   field and path — this text changes how strictly a review judges (see
   "Review instructions and context" above), so a typo must not silently
   review every configured repository against less than the operator asked
   for. `scripts/doctor.sh` runs the identical check through the same
   function, so the two can never disagree about what counts as broken.
   `repo_context_file` is deliberately outside this sweep: it names a file
   inside the repository under review, which legitimately comes and goes
   with that repository's own history, so its absence is read at R5 step 2a
   instead, and is never a fault.

R2. **Lock.** Acquire `review-lock.json` in `state_dir` recording PID, start
   time, and the writer's hostname (`host`, as the implementation pipeline's
   requirement 1 records it; its own lock, *not* the implementation
   `lock.json`). Apply the same held/stale/dead logic as requirement 1, using
   `repository_review.lock_stale_after`: skip cleanly if a live review is younger
   than the threshold; take over a stale or dead lock — TERM, a polled grace of
   up to 20 seconds so the holder's own signal handler (R7a) can write its
   record and release its claim, then KILL — logging a `warning`. Installation-
   wide only, not per repository — the lock covers whichever repositories a
   run touches, so its derivation takes the widest `timeout_review` /
   `inactivity_review` configured across all of them (defaults or any repo's
   own override), not any one repository's own. The lock has a second reader
   on a containerised node:
   `deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh` consults it, on the same
   `repository_review.lock_stale_after` bound, to defer an image roll that would
   otherwise kill a review mid-flight — judging liveness only when the lock's
   `host` is its own container, and honouring a lock written elsewhere until
   released or stale, since a pid means nothing outside the PID namespace
   that minted it (see the node stack section of
   `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`). A review is protected exactly as
   long as it would keep the lock against another review.

R3. **Stand-down checks.** Each logs its reason and exits 0:
   1. *Usage-limit cooldown* — identical to requirement 2.1: the log
      union's most recent `limit-hit` and the live `fleet/limit.json` flag
      are both read, and the **later** `resume_at` wins; if it is still in
      the future, stand down. When *this* pipeline hits a limit it writes
      the same two carriers the implementation cycle does — the `limit-hit`
      event to the shared `log.jsonl`, and the fleet flag, extend-only,
      best-effort (a `warning` is logged when the flag write fails and the
      union carries the signal instead).
   2. *Implementation pipeline busy* — if `lock.json` is held by a live
      process, stand down and wait for the next tick (defer to it, per
      "Relationship to the existing pipelines").
   3. *A dated stand-down, tier one* — if `repository_review.defaults.not_before`
      is set and now is before it, stand down the whole cycle, logging the
      timestamp on the event so an operator can tell this apart from a
      switch. Checked before the lock, like R2a, so a review that must not
      start never takes a lock a roll would then defer for. This is the
      installation-wide value only: a repository's own `not_before` override
      (requirement 342) is resolved separately, per repository, into R4's
      skip-guard below, once the cycle is under way — an override can hold
      one repository off *longer* than this value, but cannot escape it
      while it is in force. This exists because R2a's switch is deliberately
      **shared** with the implementation pipeline: holding the review pipeline
      off until a date while cycles carry on is a thing the switch cannot
      say. A value `date -d` cannot parse stands the pipeline down rather
      than running through it — the operator evidently meant to hold
      reviews off, and guessing otherwise spends whatever they were
      protecting. Absent or empty is not a stand-down. Preferred over
      raising `min_days_between_reviews` because it expires by itself: a
      threshold has to be put back by hand, and one left raised throttles
      every repo indefinitely without anyone noticing.
   4. *A dated stand-down, tier two* — checked immediately after tier one,
      also before the lock: even where `repository_review.defaults.not_before`
      itself does not trip tier one — absent, or already past — the whole
      cycle still stands down when *every* configured repository's own
      resolved `not_before` (its override, or the inherited default,
      already resolved into `repository_review_repos_json`) is future or
      unparseable. This is the case tier one alone misses: a
      `repository_review.defaults.not_before` left unset while every
      repository overrides its own, which tier one — reading only the
      installation-wide key — would let straight through to the lock, for a
      cycle certain to have R4's skip-guard skip every repository anyway.
      Vacuously false, not true, on an empty `repository_review.repos`: nothing
      configured means nothing this tier could ever hold back, not that
      everything is held.

R2a. **The switch.** Before the lock, read the shared switch
   (`state_dir/disabled.json`) through `lib/toggle.sh` and stand down while it
   is set, logging `review-stand-down` with the reason it carries — the same
   check `agent-cycle.sh` makes, through the same code, so the two pipelines
   cannot disagree about whether they are meant to be running (requirement
   34a).

   **Stands down under either of the switch's two modes** (implementation
   spec 2.3d) — a full stop (`mode: "stop"`, the default for every record
   before that field existed) and a drain (`mode: "drain"`) alike. `.state ==
   "disabled"` already reads true for both, since `mode` is a field on the
   same record rather than a different `state`, so this requires no branch of
   its own: unlike `agent-cycle.sh`, which keeps finishing already-open pull
   requests during a drain (implementation spec 2.2c/2.9), this pipeline has
   no finishing set to keep working — every review it starts is new work by
   construction — so a drain leaves it nothing to do differently from a full
   stop. Only the logged reason names which mode was in force, for a reader
   of the log wondering why a drain — nominally about letting existing work
   finish — stood this pipeline down entirely.

   The switch is **shared, not per-pipeline**, and this pipeline is the reason
   that matters rather than an afterthought. It exists because an agent editing
   the agent-ops working tree is editing files the next cron tick will source —
   and this script runs out of that same tree and sources that same `lib/`. An
   agent that stood down only the implementation pipeline before editing
   `lib/limit-detect.sh` would have left the review pipeline free to fire into
   a half-written file.

   This pipeline **honours the switch but never sets it**: `agent-cycle.sh
   --disable/--enable/--status` is the single entry point, so there is one
   writer and one record. Reject those flags here with a pointer rather than
   implementing a second way to write the same file. Leave an *expired* switch
   for `agent-cycle.sh` to clear and log, too: this pipeline runs on its own
   configured cadence (`repository_review.defaults.min_days_between_reviews`), so
   letting it clear one would mean the `enabled` event explaining why cycles
   resumed could land days after they did.

   The **fleet switch** (`fleet/disabled.json`; implementation spec 2.3a) is
   honoured on exactly the same terms, checked right after the local one:
   stand down while it is set, never write it, never clear it — not even
   expired, for the same days-late-`enabled` reason.

R2b. **The role guard.** Before the switch, the config and the lock, stand the
   run down unless `AGENT_OPS_ROLE` is `active` — the implementation pipeline's
   requirement 2.4, through the same shared `lib/role.sh`, so "active" has one
   definition and a node cannot be standby for one pipeline and active for the
   other. Unset, empty or any other value is a standby: it writes one line to
   stdout (which cron redirects into `review-cron.log`) and exits 0, leaving
   nothing in `state_dir` — not even a `review-start` event. `--dry-run` and
   `--once` bypass it, as they do there.

   The ordering matters and is deliberate: the guard comes first because a
   standby node has no business reading, logging or clearing state that belongs
   to the active one.

R2c. **The fleet's memory and state publication.** After the lock and before
   any work, snapshot the fleet's shared event stream — this node's
   `log.jsonl` unioned with every peer's, via `lib/fleet.sh`
   (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`, requirement 2.5) — so the
   usage-limit checks below see a limit *any* node hit; the union is
   re-snapshotted between repos, and each snapshot is repaired on the terms of
   that same requirement before anything reads it — a peer's NUL-holed line
   costs this pipeline the records around it exactly as it costs a cycle's.
   There is no lease: per-item claims
   (requirement 17a of the implementation spec) arbitrate work.

   Before the lock, reap `workspace_root` on the terms of the implementation
   spec's requirement 6b: this pipeline clones into the same directory and
   loses its clones to a kill in exactly the same way. Its window is its own
   — the review lock is derived from the Reviewer's budget times the
   repository count, so it is wider than a cycle's — and both are floored at
   24 hours, which is why whichever pipeline runs first cannot reap a
   workspace the other is still working in. A `workspaces-reaped` event is
   written only when something was reclaimed. At the
   end of the run — from the cleanup that releases the lock, once the review
   is fully recorded — publish this node's `state_dir` to its own
   `nodes/<NODE_NAME>` branch with `scripts/state-sync.sh push`,
   unconditionally: no other node's push can collide with it.

   The review needs this for the same reason the implementation cycle does: it
   spends, and two nodes reviewing the same repositories would open competing
   review pull requests. R4's skip-guard would not save them — two nodes
   starting within the same minute both see no open review PR. The
   review-branch claim (R5.0) is what closes that window: the second node
   loses the create-ref and skips the repo before cloning anything.

R4. **Per-repo skip-guard (idempotency; this is how "once a week" is
   enforced).** For each configured repo, skip it *this run* when **any** of
   these independent conditions holds (an OR across the three):
   - its own resolved `not_before` (its override, or
     `repository_review.defaults.not_before`, requirement 342) is set and now is
     before it — the same rule R3's cycle-wide check applies, checked again
     here per repository so a repository's own override can hold it off
     *longer* than the installation-wide value; **or**
   - an open pull request labelled with its own resolved `repository_review`
     pr_label already exists for it (a review is in-flight or awaiting
     merge); **or**
   - its default branch already contains a report directory (R4a) dated
     within the last `min_days_between_reviews` days (its own resolved
     value), **or** fewer than `min_prs_between_reviews` pull requests (its
     own resolved value) have merged into its default branch since that same
     report directory's date (read best-effort via `gh`, and only evaluated
     once a most-recent review date exists — a repository's first-ever review
     has nothing to count either threshold since). These two thresholds are
     an **AND**, not a further OR: a review proceeds only once *both* enough
     days have elapsed *and* enough pull requests have merged, so raising
     either alone raises the bar.

   Log `review-skipped` with the reason, naming the count and threshold for
   the `min_prs_between_reviews` case. This guard is what makes a **daily**
   cron tick safe and preferable to a strict weekly one: the Script only
   actually reviews a repo when at least `min_days_between_reviews` days have
   passed, so a tick missed because the machine was asleep simply catches up on
   the next day instead of losing a whole week (compare requirement note that
   "a missed cycle simply waits for the next tick"). `min_prs_between_reviews`
   defaults to 5 in code (`review-cycle.sh`) when neither
   `repository_review.defaults.min_prs_between_reviews` nor a repository's own
   override is set.

R4a. **Report directory (issue #761).** Where a report set (R11) is written,
   and where R4's own skip-guard and the implementation pipeline's
   `project-review` Refiner source (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`
   requirement 3y) look for the most recent one, is a GNU `date`(1) format
   string, resolved with `date -u +"<format>"` relative to the repository
   root — never a fixed path. Resolution, per repository (requirement 342's
   rule): its own `repository_review.repos[].report_directory` override when
   set, else `repository_review.defaults.report_directory`, else
   `reviews/project-review-%Y-%m-%d` — today's layout, fixed in code
   (`REPORT_DIRECTORY_DEFAULT` in `lib/report-directory.sh`) rather than the
   schema, so a repository configuring neither key is byte-for-byte
   unaffected by this requirement's existence. `review-cycle.sh` resolves
   this once per repository (alongside `model`, `pr_label`, `branch_prefix`
   and the rest of requirement 342's overridable keys) and passes the
   resolved directory as `report_dir` in the Reviewer-Agent's runtime input
   (R5.3) — the prompt writes into `report_dir` exactly as given, never
   re-deriving a layout of its own.

   The write path is resolved for the run's own `review_date` (`date -u -d
   "<review_date>"`), pinned once at start, never for the moment the
   repository's turn comes: repositories are reviewed sequentially (R5) and a
   single review can take an hour, so a run that crosses midnight UTC would
   otherwise write a later repository's report set into a folder dated a day
   after the branch, claim and PR title (`review/<review_date>`, R5.0) that
   name the same review. A format string must therefore be day-granular —
   only date-level specifiers (`%Y`, `%y`, `%m`, `%d`, `%j`) and literal
   text, documented on the config key. Discovery (below) probes a calendar
   day at a time, so a format carrying `%H`, `%M` or `%S` names a directory
   that resolves differently when it is looked for than when it was written:
   the skip-guard would find nothing and review the repository on every tick,
   and requirement 3y's Refiner source would go permanently empty.

   Discovering which of a format string's past instances already exist —
   needed by R4's skip-guard and by `gather-project-review.sh` — cannot
   reuse a single hardcoded pattern the way the fixed layout could, because
   an installation's format string can place its date component anywhere in
   the path. `lib/report-directory.sh` answers it generically: fold every
   leading path segment free of a `%` specifier into one static prefix (the
   common case — the whole dynamic part is the format's final segment, as
   both the shipped default and every example in the issue are shaped —
   costs exactly the one directory listing the fixed layout always made),
   list it, and match the remaining segment(s) against a regular expression
   built from the format string's own specifiers; then find which day each
   surviving candidate belongs to not by parsing its name back into a date,
   but by resolving the format string for each of the last 400 days and
   checking whether that resolved string is one of the candidates — every
   check a local `date` call, no further network cost. Both `review-cycle.sh`
   and `agent-cycle.sh` (via `lib/eligibility.sh`'s Refiner pre-fetch, which
   passes the resolved directory to `gather-project-review.sh` as its third
   argument) resolve through this one shared implementation, so the two
   pipelines cannot discover two different answers for the same repository.

R5. **Per non-skipped repo** (processed **sequentially**, so a failure of one
   never blocks the other and only one heavy `claude` runs at a time):
   0. *Claim the review branch* (R5c; implementation spec requirement 17a).
      `review/<review_date>` is a date-only name: every active node computes
      the same one on the same day, and without a lock the loser discovers
      the collision only after spending a full model review — at push time.
      Before anything expensive, claim the branch through `lib/claim.sh`
      (`claim branch <slug> review/<date> <default_branch>`): one create-ref,
      which GitHub 422s for the second caller even at the same SHA, plus the
      registry entry that back-pressure, the dashboard and gc read
      (`CLAIM_SOURCE=project-review`). A lost claim logs `review-skipped`
      ("already claimed by another node"); a claim *error* also skips the
      repo, fail closed — a node that cannot reach GitHub to claim could not
      have pushed a review either. Releases mirror the implementation
      pipeline's hooks: a failed clone or failed reviewer releases fully
      (`release branch` — the ref is deleted only if it is unmoved **and**
      no open PR uses it, so a review the model pushed before dying
      survives, as does an abandoned-but-open PR); a raised PR releases the
      registry entry only (`release file` — the PR supersedes the claim and
      the branch is its head). `--dry-run` exits before any claim.
   0a. *Git identity.* Immediately after the claim succeeds — the first point
      in this repo's run that could actually commit — require
      `GIT_USER_NAME`/`GIT_USER_EMAIL` via the shared `lib/git-identity.sh`
      (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`, "The node image"): both are
      required, with no default, and their absence exits non-zero with an
      actionable message rather than falling back to any identity. The claim's
      own lost/error skips, and every stand-down before it, commit nothing and
      are never gated on this.
   0b. *Labels.* At the same point, and for the same reason it is that point —
      this repo is now certainly going to be worked — ensure its own resolved
      `repository_review` pr_label exists in it, via `labels_reconcile_role`
      (`lib/labels.sh`), unconditionally and unstamped: the same shape
      `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 6a
      uses for its own selected repository, immediately before the stage that
      needs the label to exist, rather than the rate-limited
      `labels_reconcile_stamped` requirement 6a's per-gathered-repository
      ensure uses. The `review` role reconciles under MODE `additive`, so a
      label outside `label_prefix`'s namespace — which every shipped
      `repository_review` pr_label is — is still created only if absent and
      otherwise left exactly as the operator has it, and nothing is ever
      deleted here: only a pr_label the operator has named inside that
      namespace additionally has its colour and description reconciled
      against the catalogue's (requirement 6a). A repository is selected for
      review at most once per
      `min_days_between_reviews` days (R4), longer in every shipped
      configuration than `labels_ensure_interval_hours` (default 24h), so a
      stamp here would always have gone stale between one review of a
      repository and the next — costing the same listing a stamp would have
      saved, while leaving open the gap a shorter `min_days_between_reviews`
      or a longer `labels_ensure_interval_hours` would create: a `pr_label`
      deleted after a stamp was written going unnoticed until `gh pr create
      --label` fails the create outright, discarding a review that cost up to
      `timeout_review` minutes. Never fatal: a repository whose labels cannot
      be listed, or a token that may not create them, logs `labels-ensured`
      with what failed and the review proceeds. The event carries `created`,
      `updated`, `deleted` and `failed`, the four `labels_reconcile`'s own
      report can hold; at this call site `deleted` is always empty, MODE
      `additive` having no delete pass.
   1. *Workspace.* Create `workspace_root/<review-id>-<repo-slug-safe>/` and
      clone the repo fresh from GitHub — the multi-agent ways-of-working rule
      shared by all Poetic repositories: every agent works in its own
      dedicated fresh clone taken from the tip of the default branch before
      commencing any changes. (A full clone — the review examines git
      history.) The clone goes through `lib/repo-clone.sh`'s `clone_repo`, the
      same function the implementation pipeline's requirement 6 uses: `git
      clone`, because `gh repo clone` resolves the repository through a
      GraphQL query that is billed against the API budget, and git's own
      transport is not rate-limited. The git credential helper
      `deploy/docker/entrypoint.sh` wires — `!gh auth git-credential`, an
      unqualified `gh` that `PATH` resolves to the transport shim and so to
      the on-demand credential seam (IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC component
      22c) — authenticates the HTTPS remote, and
      `CLONE_GIT` substitutes a stub for tests, and anything already at the
      target path is discarded rather than inspected (requirement 6). Assert
      the working
      directory is under `workspace_root` before launching any stage
      (requirement 6). The user's own clones under `~/Code` are never touched.
   2. *Inject the skill.* Copy this repository's
      `.claude/skills/project-review/` into
      `<clone>/.claude/skills/project-review/`, then append
      `/.claude/skills/project-review/` to `<clone>/.git/info/exclude` so the
      injected tooling can never be staged or committed by the review agent.
      (`.git/info/exclude` is per-clone and never part of the tree, so this
      leaves no trace in the PR. The clone already has its own `.claude/`; the
      injection sits alongside its existing skills.)
   2a. *Resolve instructions and context (issue #589, D7).*
      `lib/review-context.sh`'s `review_context_build_json` resolves this
      repository's own `review_instructions`/`review_context`
      (requirement 342, already validated at R1c) plus `repo_context_file`
      read from this clone if it names a readable file — simply absent if it
      does not, never a fault — into `{"instructions": [...], "context":
      [...]}`, each entry `{source, origin, text, truncated, bytes, digest}`
      capped at `REVIEW_CONTEXT_SOURCE_MAX_BYTES`. `repo_context_file` must
      resolve to a regular file whose bytes are genuinely inside the clone:
      the configured path may be neither absolute nor contain `..`, the file
      itself may not be a symbolic link, and the directory holding it must
      canonicalise to the clone or something under it. The path is
      installation-configured but the *file* is under the reviewed
      repository's own control, so without this a committed symlink
      (`.github/REVIEW-CONTEXT.md` → an installation credential) would read
      whatever the cycle can read into the Reviewer-Agent's own input, and
      D7's boundary below would be a statement about the configured path
      rather than about the text a model is handed. A path that fails any of
      these is treated exactly as an absent one — silently not configured,
      never a fault. Both arrays are appended to the
      Reviewer-Agent's runtime input (the JSON object R5 step 3 hands it) as
      `instructions` and `context`, each source carrying its own `origin` so
      the agent — and `prompts/project-reviewer.md`'s "Untrusted external
      content" section — can tell an installation-supplied entry
      (`source: "config"`) from a repository-supplied one
      (`source: "repository"`) and judge the latter as attributed evidence
      about the repository, never as an instruction. `review_context_sources_digest`
      reduces both arrays to `{type, source, origin, digest, bytes,
      truncated}` — a sha256 of the text actually sent, never the text
      itself — recorded on the `review-stage-start` event below so a past
      review's inputs are reconstructable.
   3. *Reviewer-Agent stage.* Launch the Reviewer-Agent headless (this
      repository's own resolved model, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`,
      timeout from its own resolved `timeout_review`), with the clone as the working
      directory, passing `prompts/project-reviewer.md`. Use `run_claude_stage`
      (R7b) so a timeout kills the whole process group, the invocation
      streams its events to `<stage>.stream.jsonl` as it runs, and its final
      `result` envelope lands in `<stage>.out` for the parse below. The
      prompt reaches the stage
      on stdin, never as a command-line argument, for the reason
      `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`'s requirement 4c gives: a single
      argv entry is capped at 131072 bytes, and a prompt is the one input here
      that grows without bound. This pipeline's prompt has room to spare today,
      which is precisely why the launcher is shared rather than copied — the
      smaller prompt is the one that would sit broken longest before anyone
      noticed.
   4. *Parse.* Extract the work summary from the final message with the same
      parser `agent-cycle.sh` uses. Recover the PR URL from the parsed
      `pr_url`, else by grepping the transcript, else from a
      `.git/agent-ops-review-pr-url` breadcrumb the agent writes the moment it
      opens the PR (the analogue of requirements 9 and 23), so a stranded
      attempt is still traceable.
   5. *Outcome.* On success (`status: "complete"` and a PR URL), log
      `review-pr-raised`. On any failure (timeout, non-zero exit, unparseable
      final message, or `status` other than `complete`): log
      `review-attempt-failed` with enough detail to diagnose, and — if a PR was
      already opened — comment on it that the agent abandoned it and why,
      leaving the PR and branch for the human. That comment opens with
      `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`'s requirement 9d header,
      `**Review Script** · autonomous pipeline · node \`<node>\``, and carries
      that same requirement's invisible marker, stamped `actor=review-script`
      — harmless here, since `gather-abandoned-drafts.sh` never sees a review
      PR's `project-review` label or `review/` branch prefix, but it keeps the
      write side of the marker to the one definition in
      `lib/pipeline-marker.sh` that requirement's component describes.

R6. **Usage-limit detection.** After every `claude` invocation, run the shared
   detector (`lib/limit-detect.sh`). On a match, write a `limit-hit` event to
   the *shared* `log.jsonl` with the requirement-10 shape (`resume_at`,
   `class`, `reset_known`) and stop launching further repositories this run.
   This is a single-line, atomic `O_APPEND` write; it is safe even if the
   implementation pipeline (holding its own lock) appends concurrently, and it
   is the one signal both pipelines and the dashboard key their stand-down off.
   Both of this pipeline's stand-down checks read that signal through the same
   shared reduction, so `agent-cycle.sh --clear-limit` lifts the review cycle
   too — one account, one limit, one way to clear it.

R7. **Cleanup (always, via a trap).** Delete each cycle's clone, write a
   `review-end` event, release the review lock, and tee each stage's
   stdout/stderr to `state_dir/reviews/<review-id>/` for debugging. Optionally
   refresh the dashboard the same way `agent-cycle.sh` does (isolated and
   time-bounded, so it can never affect the run's outcome).

R7a. **A signal is a failure with a record.** The Script traps `TERM`, `INT`
   and `HUP` from the moment its cleanup trap is armed, with the same
   handler discipline — and for the same reasons, set out at length there —
   as the implementation pipeline's requirement 9c: kill the in-flight
   stage's own process group (which no signal to the Script's group ever
   reaches), log `review-attempt-failed` naming the repo under review and
   the stage in flight with detail `<stage> terminated by SIG<name>`,
   release the review claim time-bounded (`no-pr` is safe even when the
   model had already raised its PR — lib/claim.sh keeps a ref that has
   moved or that an open PR uses), and exit `128+n` through `exit`, so R7's
   trap still writes `review-end` with a truthful code and releases the
   lock. A signal landing during cleanup itself must not re-enter the
   handler. Covered by the same `test/signal-exit.test.sh` as the
   implementation pipeline's acceptance check 4a.

R7b. **One stage launcher, shared.** `run_claude_stage` is sourced from
   `lib/stage-run.sh`, the implementation pipeline's requirement 4d — it is
   not a copy of it. The two scripts each held their own until the streaming
   change of #203 had to be made twice; both specs already said the copies
   must not diverge, and a shared file is the only form of that promise a
   reviewer does not have to check by eye. Everything requirement 4d states
   holds here unchanged: the process group, the wall-clock cap, the
   `<stage>.stream.jsonl` written as the run proceeds, and the final `result`
   event truncated into `<stage>.out` for R5.3's parse. The streams are
   local-only here too — `reviews/` replicates without them, and
   `state_local_streams_retained` bounds what stays on the node.
   Requirement 4e's liveness watchdog comes with it: this repository's own
   resolved `inactivity_review` minutes of total silence stops the
   Reviewer-Agent, its own resolved `timeout_review`
   remains the backstop above it, and `review-stage-end` carries the
   `kill_reason` that tells the two apart. Absent, the shipped prior applies;
   `0` disables the watchdog and leaves the backstop as the only cap. This
   pipeline's stage is the long one — a whole project review — which is
   precisely why the distinction matters here: a review that is merely slow
   must not be killed, and one that has stopped should not hold a node for two
   hours. The same requirement's third stop applies too: a stream reporting
   the account refused stops the Reviewer-Agent at once, and
   `detect_and_log_limit_hit` derives the stand-down from the runner's own
   record rather than from prose the stopped stage never wrote.
   Both caps are *derived* rather than configured, by requirement 4f and
   through the same `lib/stage-budget.sh` the implementation pipeline uses:
   the Reviewer-Agent is the cell `(project-reviewer, <repo>, <model>)`, and
   a repository's own resolved `timeout_review` / `inactivity_review` (its
   override, or `repository_review.defaults`') are overrides that win when
   present. `review-stage-start` announces what this run was given and where
   each number came from, plus (R5 step 2a) `review_context_sources`: every
   resolved instructions/context source and a digest of its text.
   `repository_review.lock_stale_after` becomes a floor
   under a derived threshold, which takes the *widest* `timeout_review` /
   `inactivity_review` configured across every repository this run might
   touch — not any one repository's own — and multiplies it by the number of
   repositories configured for review (floored at one, so a single-repository
   installation is unaffected), because one lock can span all of them
   reviewed back to back.

R8. **Flags.** `--dry-run` (evaluate the stand-down and skip-guard checks,
   print which repos *would* be reviewed, launch no agent), `--once` (one
   verbose run in the foreground), `--repo <slug>` (restrict to one repo, for
   testing). `--disable`, `--enable`, `--status`, `--for` and `--until` are
   recognised only to reject them with a pointer to `agent-cycle.sh` (R2a) —
   an unknown-argument error would read as "this pipeline ignores the
   switch", which is the opposite of true.

### The Reviewer-Agent (`prompts/project-reviewer.md`)

R9. **One-shot constraint** (requirement 21). A single non-interactive
   `claude -p` invocation with no resumption: once it emits a final message
   with no further tool calls, it exits for good. It must wait synchronously
   for long-running commands (installs, builds, the project's own test suite)
   rather than ending its turn expecting a later notification. A command too
   slow to finish within this repository's own resolved `timeout_review` is
   grounds for `"status": "blocked"`, not a hopeful early end of turn.

R10. **Obey the repo.** Runs inside the clone. First reads the repo's
   `AGENTS.md` — or `CLAUDE.md`, for a repo that has not migrated;
   `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` where it has — and obeys it throughout
   (branch workflow, commit format, tech-debt register conventions,
   documentation-as-built rules, the `npm run check` whitespace gate, etc.).

R11. **Run the skill end-to-end.** Invoke the vendored `project-review` skill
   and follow it to completion: produce the report set (index, summary,
   findings, recommendations, improvement prompts) in `report_dir` — the
   directory the runtime input names (R4a) — and file the debt it surfaces
   per R12. The injected skill under
   `.claude/skills/project-review/` is *tooling staged for this run*, **not**
   part of the repository under review: exclude it from the review's scope and
   findings, and never `git add` it (R5b also git-excludes it as a backstop).
   Complete the skill's own resumability book-keeping (delete `worknotes/` and
   `review-state.json`) so only the finished reports remain.

R12. **File review-sourced debt as labelled issues.** New debt this review
   surfaces does not go into the register: it is filed as a GitHub issue in
   the repository under review, labelled `pw::type:tech-debt` (the label the
   implementation pipeline's own label catalogue already ensures exists there
   — `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` requirement 6a), never as a
   `tech-debt/<id>.md` file. Search first — `gh issue list --label
   pw::type:tech-debt --search "<working title>" --state all` against the
   repository under review — and a close match means the gap is already
   tracked: cite its number instead of filing a second issue for it. File
   each new item with `gh issue create --label pw::type:tech-debt`, its body
   describing what, why it matters, where, and a suggested fix — the same
   content a register item's body would have carried. Filing an issue is one
   API call, not a commit: keep the list of every issue filed this run, since
   R13's pull request body is the only record connecting the review to what
   it found, under a `Defers:` section rather than a git diff.

   Where the repository under review still carries an existing tech-debt
   register (per-item or legacy — either predating this requirement, or kept
   in place as history once a repository migrates to issue-based filing),
   never file new debt into it and never migrate it to the other format.
   Where the review finds one of its existing items already resolved, still
   update that item in place, in its own format — a per-item register's
   frontmatter status flip (`status: resolved`, `resolved:`, `ref:`), never
   its body, never deleting or renaming the file; a legacy register's own
   status update, in its established style — since that is an edit to a file
   already there, never a new one the review adds.

R12a. **Cross-reference every mirrored recommendation.** Where a GitHub issue
   R12 files covers the whole of a recommendation's *Intended end state*,
   name that recommendation's `R-NN` and this run's `report_dir` in the
   issue's own body, somewhere a reader — and a `gh issue view --json body`
   grep — will find it (e.g. a line `Review: <report_dir> R-<NN>`). Do it
   when the issue is filed, not when it is resolved.

   This is not book-keeping. A recommendation and its mirrored issue are two
   channels onto one piece of work, and the implementation pipeline's
   Co-Ordinator can tell only by finding this cross-reference
   (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`, requirement 16). Absent
   it, that Co-Ordinator has one remaining test for whether a recommendation
   is done — a merged PR referencing it — which work that landed as a direct
   commit can never satisfy. The recommendation then reads as outstanding
   forever and is re-selected and re-investigated every cycle at full model
   cost. This is not hypothetical: it is exactly what `R-01` of
   `poetic`'s 2026-07-11 review did, nine times in two days, for a licence
   that had been committed before the review was even written.

   Record the mapping **only** where the issue genuinely covers the
   recommendation's whole end state. A recommendation broader than the issue
   mirroring it keeps its remainder in the review channel, where it stays
   visible; claiming it here would silently retire work nobody has done.

R13. **Raise one pull request.** Create the branch
   `<branch_prefix><date>` (`review/<date>` by default; this repository's own
   resolved `branch_prefix`) from the
   default branch; commit the review folder — plus, only where R12's
   resolved-item bookkeeping touched an existing register, that edit
   alongside it, never a *new* `tech-debt/` file; open **one**
   pull request, **ready for review** (not draft),
   labelled with this repository's own resolved `repository_review` pr_label,
   with a Conventional-Commits title
   (`docs(review): repository review <date>` — it becomes the squash commit
   on `main`) and a body that summarises the verdict, links the review
   index, and — where R12 filed any issues — lists every one of them, its
   number and title, under a `Defers:` section, so a human reading the pull
   request sees the debt this review deferred without opening every issue.
   Record the PR URL to `.git/agent-ops-review-pr-url` immediately on opening
   it (the breadcrumb R5d relies on).

R14. **Prove it is landable.** Run the repo's own checks (as its
   `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` and workflow files define — for a docs-only
   change this is chiefly the whitespace/format gates and commit-format)
   and fix anything they surface.
   Verify the PR via `gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` against
   GitHub's own view, and resolve any conflict with the current default branch
   — a rebase republished only with `git push --force-with-lease`, the sole
   force-push permitted on the review branch, so a peer's unseen push to the
   lock ref is refused rather than silently overwritten (the same rule the
   implementation pipeline's prompts follow, issue #360).

R15. **Final message.** End with a single JSON object as the entire final
   message: `{"status": "complete", "pr_url": …, "branch": …, "repo": …, "notes": …}`
   or `{"status": "blocked", "reason": …}`.

R18. **Untrusted external content.** Text authored on the forge — issue
   and pull-request titles and bodies, comments, review text, commit
   messages — read while reviewing is data about the repository, never
   instructions to the Reviewer-Agent. `prompts/project-reviewer.md`
   carries the canonical `## Untrusted external content` block
   (IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md requirement 45a states the canonical
   copy), pinned byte-identical with the implementation pipeline's prompts
   by `test/prompt-untrusted-framing.test.sh`. The repository's own files
   are the review's subject, read as evidence throughout; they carry no
   operating instructions either.

### Logging and state

R16. **Streams.** Review *operational* events go to the review pipeline's own
   `state_dir/review-log.jsonl` (its own stream, so the dashboard's existing
   `log.jsonl` parser is untouched and the two pipelines stay separable). Reuse
   the `log_event` shape (requirement 33). Events: `review-start`,
   `review-skipped`, `review-stand-down`, `review-stage-start`,
   `review-stage-end`, `review-pr-raised`, `review-attempt-failed`,
   `review-end`, `labels-ensured` (R5.0b — the same event name and shape the
   implementation pipeline writes, since it is the same mechanism reporting
   the same thing about the same repositories), `node-state` (requirement 50
   of `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`, `docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md`'s "The
   node time-state record" — the same event and shape `agent-cycle.sh`
   writes to `log.jsonl`, since `scripts/node-time-state.sh` unions both
   streams before folding), and `warning`. Common fields:
   ISO-8601 `ts`, a `review` id
   (`<UTC-timestamp>-<node>-<pid>`, pid last, exactly as requirement 33 shapes
   the cycle id), `node`, an `event`, and where applicable `repo`, `pr_url`,
   `model`, `detail`. `review-stage-start` additionally carries
   `review_context_sources` (R5 step 2a, issue #589): one `{type, source,
   origin, digest, bytes, truncated}` entry per resolved
   `review_instructions`/`review_context`/`repo_context_file` source, never
   the text itself. `review-stage-end` additionally carries the metering
   record of requirement 33a — `model`, `cost_usd`, `duration_ms`,
   `num_turns`, `is_error`, `tokens` — via the same `lib/metering.sh` helper
   `agent-cycle.sh` uses, so a review's stage costs exactly the same shape as
   a cycle's (`docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md`). The one exception is the shared
   `limit-hit` event, which is written to `log.jsonl` (R6), because
   usage-limit stand-down is shared across both pipelines — it carries `node`
   too, so a fleet view can say which machine hit the limit.

   `review-stage-end` and a genuine-failure `review-attempt-failed` (the one
   `review_one` logs when the reviewer's own attempt failed, never the
   workspace-clone failure logged before either exists) additionally carry
   `stage: "project-reviewer"` and a `cycle` field, for R19's benefit alone —
   nothing else on this stream reads either. `cycle` is a synthetic
   `<review id>:<repo>` pair, not the bare `review` id every other event on
   this stream carries: a single run can review several repositories under
   one `review` id (R5's per-repo loop), so the bare id would let
   `lib/stage-health.sh`'s own id-keyed join (requirement 2.8's
   exit-0-but-failed reduction) attach one repository's genuine failure to
   another's success. The genuine-failure `review-attempt-failed` also
   carries `stage_failure: true`, on requirement 2.8's own convention — this
   call only ever fires on a genuine attempt failure, never a truthful item
   verdict a stage reached by running to completion (the repository-review
   pipeline raises no such verdict: it either raises a pull request or it
   does not).

R17. The `review-log.jsonl` and the `state_dir/reviews/<review-id>/`
   transcripts are the durable record. Surfacing the transcripts themselves,
   or the raw log, in the monitoring dashboard is a worthwhile follow-on but
   is **out of scope** for this document (the dashboard has its own spec,
   `docs/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md`); note it there if you extend it. R19 is the one
   derived reading of `review-log.jsonl` that is in scope: a per-stage health
   verdict, not the log itself.

R19. **Per-stage health, mirrored (agent-ops#996).** The repository-review
   pipeline's own symmetric reading of `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`
   requirement 2.8: this pipeline runs one real stage, `project-reviewer`
   (R9–R15, the Reviewer-Agent invocation `review_one` makes), and until this
   requirement nothing read whether its most recent run of attempts on this
   node was succeeding — the exact detection gap issue #662 closed for the
   implementation pipeline's nine stages, left open here because #662's own
   scope was `log.jsonl`'s `stage-end` records, never `review-log.jsonl`'s.

   `lib/stage-health.sh`'s `stage_health_verdicts`/`stage_health_write_status`
   (requirement 2.8) are generalized to take the stage-end/attempt-failed
   event names and the output filename as parameters (default
   `stage-end`/`attempt-failed`/`.stage-health.json`, unchanged for the
   implementation pipeline's own callers). `review-cycle.sh`'s `cleanup()`
   trap calls `stage_health_write_status` once every run, after `review-end`
   is logged and before the state-sync push, narrowed to `["project-reviewer"]`
   over `review-log.jsonl`'s own `review-stage-end`/`review-attempt-failed`
   events (R16) rather than the shared `stage-end`/`attempt-failed`, and
   writes to its own `state_dir/.review-stage-health.json` — never merged
   into the implementation pipeline's `.stage-health.json`, whose "two
   writers, one file" read-modify-write discipline (requirement 2.8) was
   designed and tested for exactly the two writers it already has
   (`agent-cycle.sh`, `monitor-cycle.sh`); a third writer sharing that file
   would reopen the identical lost-update risk that discipline exists to
   bound.

   Unlike the implementation pipeline's per-stage streak — one attempt per
   cycle, so a cycle id is never reused within one stage's own `stage-end`
   list — a single `review-cycle.sh` run's `review` id can cover several
   repositories (R5's per-repo loop), so the bare id would let the
   exit-0-but-failed join (requirement 2.8's TD-PPagop-26082504 reduction)
   attach one repository's genuine failure to another repository's success
   within the same run. R16's `cycle` field (`<review id>:<repo>`) is what
   keeps that join scoped correctly; `consecutive_failures` itself still
   counts across every attempt this stage has logged, run after run,
   regardless of which repository each one reviewed — the same single
   streak requirement 2.8 already computes for `coordinator`/`implementer`/
   etc., asking the identical question of `project-reviewer`: is this
   pipeline's one real stage's most recent run of attempts on this node
   succeeding?

   The verdict is not local to the node that computed it, on requirement
   2.8's identical precedent: `scripts/state-sync.sh`'s heartbeat folds it in
   as `review_stage_health`, a field of its own beside `stage_health` rather
   than merged into it, and `.review-stage-health.json` is excluded from
   general state replication the same way `.stage-health.json` is, so its
   content travels exactly once, through the heartbeat.
   `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh` reads its own `.review-stage-health.json`
   (rather than recomputing it) and surfaces it as
   `status.review_stage_health`; a peer's verdict comes from its heartbeat's
   `review_stage_health` field or reads null, never a verdict this node
   derives on that peer's behalf. `docs/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md` documents the
   page's own Review stage health section, its own page-top banner, and its
   own fleet-strip badge — each independent of `stage_health`'s own, so a
   node whose implementation-pipeline stages are all healthy while
   `project-reviewer` fails reads as failing too, never masked by the other
   panel's green verdict, or the reverse.

## Components

What exists, and the requirements each part answers to:

1. `review-cycle.sh` implementing R1–R8, R16 and R19 (including the role guard,
   R2b, through `lib/role.sh`, the union snapshot and state push of R2c, through
   `scripts/state-sync.sh`, the per-repository instructions and context of
   R1c and R5 step 2a through `lib/review-context.sh`, shared with
   `scripts/doctor.sh` so the cycle's own refusal and doctor's `fail` read
   one implementation, the metering record on `review-stage-end`
   through `lib/metering.sh`, shared with `agent-cycle.sh` — see
   `docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md` — and R19's own stage-health verdict through
   `lib/stage-health.sh`, shared with `agent-cycle.sh`/`monitor-cycle.sh`).
   `shellcheck`-clean; sets its own `PATH`.
2. `prompts/project-reviewer.md` implementing R9–R15. It must embed the
   relevant shared-repo conventions (as the other operating prompts do) so the
   stage never depends on context it was not given.
3. `.claude/skills/project-review/` — the vendored skill (pinned; re-sync
   from upstream deliberately).
4. `config.json` — the `repository_review` block.
5. `README.md` — a "Repository review" section: what it does and why (the
   loop it closes), every `repository_review.*` config key, how to install the
   cron entry,
   how to operate it (`--dry-run`, `--once`, `--repo`, reading
   `review-log.jsonl` and the transcripts), how the outputs feed the
   implementation pipeline / `project-remediation`, and how to uninstall.
6. The crontab line(s) (see "Host provisioning").

## Acceptance checks

Every change to this pipeline must leave all of these passing; before opening
a pull request, run the ones the change touches and any it could regress.

The implementation pipeline's *Acceptance checks* preamble carries one rule
that applies here unchanged: **no check may expect a particular value from
`config.json`.** The shipped file is asserted to be valid; every fixture
supplies its own `repository_review` block, or mutates
`test/fixtures/config-base.json`. Changing a threshold, a cadence or a
reviewed repository is a configuration change, and must not oblige anyone to
edit a test.

1. `shellcheck review-cycle.sh` is clean.
2. `--dry-run` completes against the real repos: the stand-down and skip-guard
   checks are evaluated, the Script prints which repos it *would* review,
   nothing further launches, and `review-log.jsonl` records the run.
3. A second invocation while the review lock is held exits without acting; and
   while the implementation `lock.json` is held by a live process, the Review
   Script stands down.
4. Skip-guard: with today's report directory present on a repo's default
   branch — `reviews/project-review-<today>/` under the shipped fallback, or
   whatever that repo's own resolved `report_directory` names (R4a) — (or an
   open `project-review`-labelled PR for it), that repo is skipped, and the
   `min_days_between_reviews` boundary is respected.
4b. **The role guard stands this pipeline down too (R2b).** `test/role.test.sh`
   passes: a `review-cycle.sh` with `AGENT_OPS_ROLE` unset or standby exits 0
   with one line and writes nothing under `state_dir`, while `--dry-run` runs
   regardless of the role.
4c. **A peer's usage-limit hit stands this pipeline down too (R2c/R6).** With
   a peer's materialised log carrying a `limit-hit` whose `resume_at` is in
   the future, `review-cycle.sh` logs a `review-stand-down`, exits 0 and
   clones nothing; its cleanup still pushes this node's state to its own
   branch (`test/state-sync.test.sh` covers the shared machinery).
4a. **The switch stands this pipeline down too (R2a).** With
   `agent-cycle.sh --disable 'testing'` set, a plain `review-cycle.sh` logs a
   `review-stand-down` carrying the reason, exits 0, and launches no `claude`;
   `--enable` restores it. Check this against the *review* script specifically
   and not by inference from `agent-cycle.sh` passing — a shared switch that
   only one pipeline reads is the whole failure mode R2a exists to prevent, and
   it looks identical to a working one until the week a review fires into a
   half-edited `lib/`. The same one-pipeline-blind hazard applies to the
   fleet switch, so `test/toggle.test.sh`'s offline e2e runs the real
   `review-cycle.sh` against a set `fleet/disabled.json` and asserts the
   `review-stand-down` names it.
4d. **The review-branch claim gates the review (R5.0).**
   `test/review-claim.test.sh` passes: against a stubbed `lib/claim.sh` seam
   (`CLAIM_GH`) and a fail-fast `gh`, a *lost* claim logs `review-skipped`
   naming another node and never attempts a clone; a claim *error* skips the
   same way, fail closed; a *won* claim proceeds (the stub records
   `claim branch <slug> review/<date> <default-branch>` in that order), and
   when the clone then fails, `release branch` is invoked for the same key —
   the leak the implementation pipeline fixed in its own workspace path
   (#55) must not be reintroduced here.
4e. **Per-repository resolution, and duplicate slugs refused (R1b).**
   `test/config-schema.test.sh` passes: `config_repository_review_repos` resolves
   an entry carrying only `slug` to every one of `repository_review.defaults`'
   values, an entry setting a key to its own value for that key alone, and an
   explicit `null` back to the default — including the `model_key` each
   resolution names, which is what an unsupported provider is reported
   against (R1a). `config_defaults` fabricates none of the overridable keys
   into a `repos[]` entry: a schema `default` on one would materialise it in
   every entry, so the entry would always "set" it and `defaults` could never
   apply — which is why only the properties under `defaults` may carry one.
   And a config naming the same `slug` twice exits `review-cycle.sh` 1 before
   the lock, naming the repeated slug, while `scripts/doctor.sh` `fail`s on
   the same config through the same `lib/config-schema.sh` function. Check the
   refusal against the *review* script and not by inference from `doctor.sh`:
   `uniqueItems` cannot express this rule — it compares whole objects, so two
   entries for one repository carrying different overrides are distinct to it
   — so nothing else catches it, and the run would otherwise resolve that
   repository from whichever entry it happened to read last.
4f. **The dated stand-down is two-tier (R3.3).**
   `test/review-not-before.test.sh` passes: a future
   `repository_review.defaults.not_before` stands the whole cycle down before the
   lock, with the date on the event; and with that key empty while *every*
   configured repository's own `not_before` override is still in the future,
   the cycle stands down before the lock too, logging one `review-stand-down`
   naming requirement 342. An empty `repository_review.repos` is vacuously *not*
   a stand-down. And the converse, which is what proves the two tiers are
   really two: with one repository held on its own override while another is
   free, neither tier fires, the cycle runs, and R4's skip-guard turns the
   held repository away by name with its own date while the free one goes on
   to be claimed. Check that case specifically — a `not_before` that had
   quietly stayed cycle-wide passes every other assertion in that file and
   fails only this one, and the failure it stands for is a repository nobody
   asked to hold being held by its neighbour's date.
4g. **The report directory is configurable, and unset is unchanged (R4a).**
   `test/report-directory.test.sh` passes: against a stubbed `gh`,
   `report_directory_find_dirs` discovers a format string's existing
   instances — folding a leading static segment (`docs/`) into the one
   listing the fixed layout always made, and still resolving a format whose
   date component sits in a middle segment — and
   `report_directory_most_recent` names the latest of them with its own date,
   printing nothing where none exist. `report_directory_regex` escapes
   literal regex metacharacters in a format's surrounding text and degrades
   an unrecognised specifier to a wildcard rather than failing.
   `test/config-schema.test.sh` covers the resolution: a repository's own
   `report_directory` wins over `repository_review.defaults`', absent it
   inherits, and absent from both it resolves empty rather than fabricated —
   which is what leaves `REPORT_DIRECTORY_DEFAULT` the single fallback.
   Check the unset case against a test that names no directory of its own:
   `test/gather-project-review.test.sh` passes **unmodified**, which is what
   proves an installation configuring neither key reads and writes exactly
   the paths it did before this requirement existed.

   The write path's pinning (R4a) is checked by reading `review_one`, no test
   reaching it without a full model run: `report_dir` resolves through
   `date -u -d "$review_date"`, never a fresh `date -u`. A fresh call passes
   every test above and fails only a sequential run crossing midnight UTC —
   where the second repository's report folder is dated a day after the
   branch, claim and PR title of the same review.
4h. **Instructions and context reach the review, and a broken configured path
   never silently narrows one (R1c, R5 step 2a).**
   `test/review-context.test.sh` passes: `review_context_build_json` resolves
   this repository's own `review_instructions`/`review_context` into
   `instructions`/`context` entries attributed `source: "config"`, in
   configured order and ahead of the `repo_context_file` entry attributed
   `source: "repository"`; an oversized source is capped at
   `REVIEW_CONTEXT_SOURCE_MAX_BYTES` and marked `truncated`; and
   `review_context_sources_digest` reduces both arrays to a digest per source
   carrying no `text` field. `review_context_missing_configured` reports a
   configured path that names no readable *regular* file — a directory
   included, which is readable and would otherwise contribute a silently
   empty source — and reports nothing where neither key is configured.
   `repo_context_file` is confined to the clone's own bytes: a `..` in the
   configured path, a symbolic link (pointing out of the clone *or* back into
   it), and a path reached through a symlinked directory each contribute
   nothing, while the ordinary regular file the link pointed at is admitted
   as usual. Check the symlink cases specifically: the configured path is the
   installation's, but the file it names is under the reviewed repository's
   own control, and both `-r` and `head -c` follow a link out of the clone —
   a bound on the path alone leaves D7's boundary a statement about the path
   rather than about the text a model is handed.

   `test/review-context-wiring.test.sh` passes, which is what proves R1c is
   wired rather than merely available: a broken `review_instructions` path
   exits the real `review-cycle.sh` 1 before the lock and before any
   repository is touched, naming the repository, the field, the configured
   path and what it resolved to; a broken `review_context` override on one
   repository's own `repos[]` entry refuses the same way, naming that
   repository and not its neighbour (the sweep reads requirement 342's
   resolved view, not `defaults` alone); and a path that does resolve, or
   neither key configured at all, ends the tick 0 with no refusal. Check the
   refusal against the *review script* and not by inference from
   `scripts/doctor.sh` passing: a sweep written but never called, or called
   after the lock, satisfies the unit test and doctor's assertions alike and
   still reviews every configured repository against less than the operator
   asked for. `test/config-schema.test.sh` covers the rest of the
   configuration surface: both keys are arrays of non-empty strings, never a
   bare string; `repo_context_file` is a bare string; all three resolve on
   requirement 342's rule; and `scripts/doctor.sh` turns the same detector's
   report into a `fail`, not the `warn` a `prompt_overrides` path earns.
5. **Injected-skill isolation:** after a real `--once --repo poetic` run, the
   review PR's diff contains the new `reviews/...` folder but **never** a
   *new* `tech-debt/*.md` file (only an existing item's frontmatter, where
   R12's resolved-item bookkeeping touched one) and **not**
   `.claude/skills/project-review/` — confirm the injected skill is
   git-excluded and absent from the PR, and confirm any debt the review
   surfaced landed as issues instead: `gh issue list --repo Poetic-Poems/poetic
   --label pw::type:tech-debt --state all` shows a fresh issue per finding,
   each named under the PR body's `Defers:` section.
6. Usage-limit: an injected future `limit-hit` on `log.jsonl` stands the review
   down; and a simulated limit phrase in a transcript causes a `limit-hit` to
   be written to `log.jsonl`.
7. One supervised full run (`--once`): for each non-skipped repo it produces a
   labelled, ready, mergeable review PR, with every item of debt it surfaced
   filed as a `pw::type:tech-debt`-labelled GitHub issue in that repo (R12),
   named under the PR's `Defers:` section, and a clean `review-log.jsonl`
   trail. Report the PR URL(s) to the human; merge nothing.
8. **Cross-references land (R12a):** for every issue that run filed which
   mirrors a recommendation, `gh issue view <n> --json body --jq .body`
   contains its `R-NN`. Check this explicitly: it is invisible in the
   review's own output — the reports look complete either way — and only
   shows up weeks later as the implementation pipeline paying to
   re-investigate recommendations that are already done.

9. **The untrusted-content framing holds for the Reviewer-Agent too
   (R18).** `test/prompt-untrusted-framing.test.sh` passes — it lifts the
   canonical block from IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md requirement 45a and
   pins `prompts/project-reviewer.md`'s copy byte-identical alongside the
   implementation pipeline's own prompts.

10. **A stage-health verdict for `project-reviewer` (R19, agent-ops#996).**
   `test/stage-health.test.sh` passes: `stage_health_verdicts` told the
   review pipeline's own event names reads a `review-log.jsonl`-shaped stream
   correctly — including the exit-0-but-failed join over the synthetic
   `(review id, repo)`-scoped `cycle` field, and that two repositories
   reviewed under one `review` id do not cross-contaminate each other's
   verdict — while the default event names stay blind to that same stream,
   proving the parameter is load-bearing, not decorative; and a custom
   `STATUS_FILENAME` writes its own file, leaving `.stage-health.json`
   untouched. `test/review-stage-health-wiring.test.sh` passes: the shipped
   `review-stage-end`/`review-attempt-failed` calls carry `stage`, the
   synthetic `cycle`, and (the genuine-failure one) `stage_failure: true`;
   `cleanup()` computes the verdict from `review_log_file` narrowed to
   `["project-reviewer"]`, over this stream's own event names, into
   `.review-stage-health.json`, before the state-sync push. `test/state-sync
   .test.sh` passes: `.review-stage-health.json` does not replicate as a raw
   file, and its content reaches the heartbeat as `review_stage_health`, a
   field of its own alongside `stage_health`. `test/publish-dashboard.test.sh`
   and `test/dashboard-render.test.sh` pass: `status.review_stage_health` and
   `fleet.nodes[].review_stage_health` read verbatim from the written file and
   a peer's heartbeat respectively, and the page's Review stage health
   section, its own page-top banner and its own fleet-strip badge render
   independently of `stage_health`'s own — a node whose implementation-
   pipeline stages are all healthy while `project-reviewer` fails must read
   as failing too, never masked by the other panel's green verdict.

## Host provisioning (human steps)

All of this is in place on the current host; it is needed again only when
standing the pipeline up on a new machine.

1. Create the review label in each configured repo:
   `gh api -X POST repos/Poetic-Poems/<repo>/labels -f name='project-review' -f color='5319e7' -f description='Raised by the project-review pipeline'`
   (for each repository in `repository_review.repos`).
2. Install the cron entry. **Recommended — a daily tick guarded by
   `min_days_between_reviews`**, which is robust to a machine that sleeps:
   ```
   30 3 * * * $HOME/Code/Poetic-Poems/agent-ops/review-cycle.sh >> $HOME/.local/state/poetic-agents/review-cron.log 2>&1
   ```
   The skip-guard (R4) ensures this actually reviews each repo only about once a
   week. *Strict weekly alternative* (simpler, but a missed Monday tick skips
   the whole week): `30 3 * * 1 …` (Mondays 03:30). Schedule it at a different
   minute from the implementation cycle's own tick to avoid both firing at once
   (the review defers to a running cycle anyway, per R3). The crontab
   environment must also set `AGENT_OPS_ROLE=active` on the node that is to run
   the reviews (R2b); without it every tick stands down.

   On a containerised node this entry is not installed by hand at all: it is
   the review line of `deploy/docker/crontab`, which the scheduler service runs
   under supercronic (see the node image section of
   `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`). Its hour and minute are rendered
   per node at container start (design decision D5): `config.json`'s
   `schedule.review_offset_minutes` (`29`) past `CYCLE_MINUTE` (mod 60), at
   `schedule.review_hour` (`3`), so the node's two heavy pipelines sit
   maximally apart within its hour and no two nodes review at the same
   moment either. The role comes from `ROLE` in the node's
   `deploy/docker/.env` rather than from a crontab line, and defaults to
   standby when it is missing.
3. The shared prerequisites of `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` (the standalone `claude`
   CLI, cron enabled under WSL, `gh` authenticated with push access) are
   already satisfied by the implementation pipeline; nothing further is needed.

## Cost profile

One deep review per repo per week: a Sonnet lead driving the skill, which
itself delegates to lower-cost subagents. Bounded by each repository's own
resolved `timeout_review`.
The skip-guard caps it at one review per repo per `min_days_between_reviews`, so
a daily cron tick does not multiply cost. Deferring to the implementation lock
keeps the two pipelines from doubling up on quota at the same moment. The Script
itself makes no model calls.

## Design decisions

Recorded so a future reader knows they were deliberate. History and
superseded approaches belong here, never in the requirements above, which
state only what is.

- **A separate pipeline, not a new stage of `agent-cycle.sh`.** A review is
  weekly, long, and whole-repo; the implementation cycle is hourly, short, and
  single-item. Bolting the review onto the cycle would either starve the cycle
  (a review holding the shared lock for hours) or complicate its per-stage
  timeouts. A sibling Script with its own lock, label, and cron keeps each
  simple — while a single shared `limit-hit` signal and a one-way deference
  (review yields to a running cycle) keep them from fighting over quota.
- **The skill is vendored into the orchestrator and injected into the clone**,
  not committed into the product repos. Reproducible (pinned, in this repo's
  version control, not the machine's symlinked global skill), keeps the product
  repos clean, keeps the review out of its own scope, and needs no pull request
  into two protected product repositories to switch the pipeline on.
- **The review PR is raised ready, not draft.** The review is the deliverable;
  there is no correctness pass to add (unlike the Implementer→Reviewer
  hand-off), so a second agent stage would only add cost. The landing gate is the
  merge.
- **"Once a week" is implemented as a daily tick plus a skip-guard**, because a
  strict weekly cron on a machine that sleeps can miss its one tick and lose a
  whole week. The guard also makes re-runs idempotent.
- **The outputs feed the existing pipelines by design.** The review files
  debt straight to GitHub as labelled issues the hourly Co-Ordinator's
  `issues` work source can already pick up, and writes the improvement
  prompts the `project-remediation` skill consumes — so the review is the
  front of an existing loop, not a parallel dead-end.
- **Review-sourced debt is filed as GitHub issues, not register entries
  (agent-ops#876, D15).** The register served this well while an item's ID
  needed to be race-safe across concurrent human and agent writers and its
  filing needed to survive as an immutable per-item file; GitHub issues give
  both natively — an issue number allocates atomically, and a labelled issue
  cannot silently conflict with another. Filing therefore costs one API call
  (`gh issue create --label pw::type:tech-debt`) instead of an ID
  reservation and a commit, and the review PR's `Defers:` section is the
  record connecting the review to what it found, in place of a register diff
  the pull request used to carry. A repository's existing register, where it
  still has one, is left exactly as it was: history, never a second place
  new debt lands (R12).
- **`min_days_between_reviews` is 6, not 7**, so a review that lands a day late
  one week is not deferred a full extra week the next.

The shared platform, models, permissions, and system location were confirmed
with the repo owner for the implementation pipeline and carry over unchanged;
no open questions remain.
