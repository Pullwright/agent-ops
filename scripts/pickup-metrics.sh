# scripts/pickup-metrics.sh — answer issue #248's acceptances 4 and 5 from the
# union event log: median/p90 pickup latency, and no increase in duplicate-
# work incidents, both relative to before finish-then-continue.
#
# Acceptance 5 — duplicate work. The data already exists (TD-PPagop-26080808):
# every claim miss logs `claim-lost` with a `cause`, and `selection` marks a
# won claim, so the measure is contended claim losses per selection — `cause`
# of `held` or `pr-held` (WI-2/#238 renames a PR-keyed `held` loss to
# `pr-held`; counting only `held` would silently undercount after it) — over
# `claim-lost` whose cause is neither, which is an ordinary first-try miss and
# not contention. A `claim-lost` carrying no `cause` at all, from before
# requirement 17a added the field, is excluded rather than guessed at.
#
# The before/after split is **per node, at that node's own first `chained`
# event**, not at #268's merge timestamp: watchtower rolls an image out to
# each node at its own real time, so only a node's own evidence that it
# actually exercised finish-then-continue marks when its own contention
# picture could have changed. A node with no `chained` event at all — in the
# log, or before --since narrowed what this run can see — is entirely
# "before": it has not been seen to adopt the change. The first-chained
# lookup itself is never bounded by --since, since adoption can predate the
# window a report asks about; only the counted events and the reported
# window are.
#
# Acceptance 4 — pickup latency (TD-PPagop-26081405). agent-cycle.sh's
# `emit_first_seen` logs one `first-seen` per item the first time any node's
# gather ever reports it; this script pairs each with the `selection` that
# later claims the same {repo, item} and reports the gap in seconds. Where two
# nodes raced to log the same item's `first-seen` almost simultaneously (the
# write itself is best-effort, not behind the atomic claim), the earliest of
# the duplicates wins — same first-wins-by-ts reduction as everywhere else
# this log is reduced. An item logged `bootstrap: true` — a node's own first
# cycle ever emitting `first-seen`, where most of what it "first" sees has in
# truth existed for a while — is excluded from the median/p90, since its
# latency measures this node's cold start, not a real pickup; it is still
# counted, separately, so the exclusion is visible rather than a silent drop.
# An item with only one of the pair — first-seen but not yet claimed, or
# claimed but logged before this instrumentation existed — contributes to
# neither the count nor the latency and is reported instead under `coverage`,
# so a low measured count is never mistaken for a low pickup rate.
#
# `cadence_bound_minutes` (`config.json`'s `schedule.cycle_interval_minutes`)
# is not a statistic of the log — it is the floor under every latency this
# script can ever report: a poll-based `first-seen` is only as fresh as the
# gather that logged it, which runs once per cycle, so no interval this script
# computes can be trusted below roughly one cycle's width.
#
# --since bounds first-seen/selection pairing the same way it bounds every
# other count here: an event outside the window is not counted, which means a
# pickup whose `first-seen` predates --since but whose `selection` falls
# inside it is undercounted as `selection_only` rather than paired — the same
# trade every other --since-bounded count in this script already makes, and
# deliberate for the same reason: the alternative is a report whose window
# argument no longer bounds what was actually read.
#
# Read-only throughout: it opens nothing but the union log (`lib/fleet.sh`'s
# `fleet_logs`) and this repository's own `config.json` (never a target
# repo's), and prints a JSON object to stdout. Never touches the lock, writes
# no event, makes no network call, and is safe to run against a live node at
# any time.

Read-only. Prints, as JSON on stdout:

  - the count of `selection` events and of contended `claim-lost` events
    (cause `held` or `pr-held`) split into "before"/"after" eras — per node,
    at that node's own first `chained` event — plus each era's ratio
    (contended losses per selection): issue #248 acceptance 5.
  - `pickup_latency`: the count, median and p90 (seconds) of the gap between
    each item's `first-seen` and the `selection` that claimed it, fleet-wide
    (`.fleet`) and per node (`.by_node`, keyed by the claiming node) — plus
    `bootstrap_excluded_count`, paired items left out of those figures
    because their `first-seen` carried `bootstrap: true`: issue #248
    acceptance 4.
  - `pickup_latency_forge_anchored`: the same shape as `pickup_latency`, but
    measured from the item's own forge `created_at` (when its `first-seen`
    carries one — see lib/candidate-select.sh's `emit_first_seen`) to
    `selection`, rather than from this fleet's own poll-driven `first-seen`
    (requirement 54, issue #613). `cadence_bound_minutes` below is not a
    floor on this figure: a wake-poll-driven pickup can beat it, which is
    the whole point — `pickup_latency` cannot show that, since waking a node
    moves both its own `first-seen` and its `selection` earlier by the same
    amount.
  - `coverage`: `paired` (both events seen), `first_seen_only` (seen, not yet
    claimed), `selection_only` (claimed, but never `first-seen` — e.g.
    predating this instrumentation) and `forge_anchored` (paired items whose
    `first-seen` carried a usable `forge_created_at`) item counts.
  - `cadence_bound_minutes`: this repository's own `schedule.cycle_interval_minutes`
    — the noise floor under `pickup_latency` above, since a poll-based
    `first-seen` is only as fresh as the gather that logged it; not a floor
    on `pickup_latency_forge_anchored`, see above.
  - `window`: the timestamps the report covers.

  --since       only count events at or after this ISO-8601 timestamp
                (default: the whole log). Does not affect which `chained`
                event counts as a node's first — adoption can predate the
                window a report asks about.
  --state-dir   this node's own log directory (default: config.json's
                state_dir)
  --peers-dir   the peers directory fleet_logs reads (default:
                fleet_peers_dir over config.json's workspace_root)

Needs no network access and changes nothing.
