# gather-workflow-basenames.sh — map a repository's workflow ids to the
# basename the Co-Ordinator mints a `failed-runs` item id from (requirement
# 19: "`item` is `failed-run-` plus the workflow file's basename without
# extension").
#
# Given a repo slug, print one JSON object:
#
#   {"ok": true, "basenames": {"123": "ci", "456": "sync-framework"}}
#
# `gather-source-state.sh`'s own `workflows` digest carries each workflow's
# *id* and its latest conclusion (`{"w": 123, "c": "failure"}`) — the id, not
# the file it came from, because the id is all the no-op fingerprint needs.
# Requirement 34n's liveness retirement needs the other half: which basename a
# still-failing id names, so a void `failed-run-<basename>` can be tested for
# whether that basename's workflow is still failing this cycle. This is the
# one read that answers it, kept separate from gather-source-state.sh because
# it is needed only for the (usually empty) residue of still-unretired
# `failed-run-` void entries — see requirement 34n in
# docs/spec/implementation/README.md.
#
# Usage: gather-workflow-basenames.sh <owner/repo>
#
# `ok: false` on any API failure — auth, rate limit, network, an unparseable
# body — never on a legitimately empty workflow list, which is `ok: true` with
# an empty `basenames`. Requirement 34n's own "unknown is not gone" rule reads
# `ok` before trusting the map for anything: an unsampled repo must decide no
# retirement, not "no workflows".
#
# Never exits non-zero: it always prints a valid object. A gatherer that
# aborted the cycle would make a tidy-up a reliability risk.

# void in exactly the busiest repositories unretirable, which is the growth
