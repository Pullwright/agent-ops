# state-sync.sh — publish each node's pipeline memory as its own branch of a
# private GitHub repository, and mirror every peer's back for union reads.
#
# The pipelines' memory lives in state_dir: what has been tried, what is
# blocked, what each cycle cost. Under the multi-active fleet every node is a
# writer, so there is no one state to adopt and no lease to arbitrate who may
# write it — work is arbitrated per item by the claims of requirement 17a
# (lib/claim.sh), and state is per node:
#
#   state-sync.sh push    publish this node's state_dir as the rolling branch
#                         `nodes/<NODE_NAME>` — every node, every few minutes
#                         and at the end of every cycle; contention-free,
#                         because no two nodes share a branch
#   state-sync.sh fetch   materialise every peer's branch under the peers
#                         directory (lib/fleet.sh), where the union readers —
#                         blocked/void extraction, the no-op fingerprint, the
#                         usage-limit cooldown, the fleet dashboard — find
#                         them as ordinary local files
#
# Every mode is a silent no-op when `state_repo` is unset in config.json, so a
# lone node behaves exactly as it did before the fleet existed.

usage: state-sync.sh push|fetch

Publish this node's state_dir as its own branch (`nodes/<NODE_NAME>`) of the
private repository named by `state_repo` in config.json, and mirror the other
nodes' branches back for union reads.

  push      Mirror state_dir into the node's own rolling branch, stamped with
            a heartbeat ({node, role, ts, last_cycle}). Every node pushes —
            an active node publishes its cycles, a standby its liveness.
  fetch     Refresh the local copy of every peer's branch into the peers
            directory (see lib/fleet.sh). Prunes a peer whose branch is gone.

Exit codes: 0 done or nothing to do · 1 failure.

Environment:
  NODE_NAME             this node's name — the branch and heartbeat carry it
                        (defaults to the hostname).
  AGENT_OPS_ROLE        recorded in the heartbeat; gates neither mode.
  STATE_SYNC_REMOTE     override the remote URL (tests point it at a bare repo).
  STATE_SYNC_MIRROR     override the local mirror checkout's location.
  STATE_SYNC_LOCAL_RETAINED
                        override `state_local_cycles_retained` (tests use a
                        small value).
  STATE_SYNC_STREAMS_RETAINED
                        override `state_local_streams_retained` (likewise).
  STATE_SYNC_PUSH_DEADLINE_SECONDS
                        override the redaction loop's deadline, normally one
                        push interval (tests use a small value).
  STATE_SYNC_MIN_FREE_WORKSPACE_BYTES
                        override `min_free_workspace_bytes` (tests only).
  STATE_SYNC_FREE_KB    override the free-space reading `push` takes of
                        state_dir's filesystem for the disk-pressure prune
                        below (tests only — a real push always reads it via
                        lib/disk-space.sh).

# --- What is memory and what is merely local ---------------------------------
# Excluded from the branch in both directions:
#
#   the locks       a copied lock.json is a lock no process holds; peers read
#                   logs, never locks. `roll-pending.json` (agent-ops#1096)
#                   travels the same way and for the same reason: it is this
#                   node's own instruction to its own watchtower hook to
#                   allow an update despite its own lock, for a window only
#                   this node's own cycle boundary can have earned — a copy on
#                   a peer would tell that peer's hook to allow a roll nothing
#                   about that peer actually asked for.
#   this script's   `state-sync.log` is where a node records its own
#   own log          replication; replicating it would be a node describing
#                   another node's description of itself.
#   the dashboard   `dashboard/` is generated from the state beside it, and the
#                   logs and caches beside it (`dashboard.log`,
#                   `dashboard-server.log`, `.dashboard-github.json`,
#                   `.dashboard-claims.json`, `.dashboard-tick-cost`) are one
#                   node's rendering machinery. Each node republishes its own
#                   page from the union it fetches; copying the pixels would
#                   be copying a derivative of what we are already copying.
#   the image-drift `.image-drift-cache.json` is this node's own last read of
#   cache            the registry (lib/image-drift.sh) — a peer's copy of it
#                   would answer for a registry query nobody there ran, not
#                   for that peer.
#   the publication `.state-sync-published.json` (agent-ops#602) is this
#   cache            node's own read-back of what the shared state holds for
#                   its own branch — a peer's copy of it would answer for a
#                   fetch nobody there ran, on the identical reasoning as
#                   the image-drift cache above. Unlike `.stage-health.json`
#                   below, no peer ever needs this node's own answer to "am
#                   I fresh" — a peer already judges this node by this
#                   node's `heartbeat.json` `ts`, which a failed push simply
#                   never advances — so nothing folds it into the heartbeat
#                   either; it exists purely for this node's own dashboard
#                   and doctor.sh to read back its own published state
#                   instead of trusting its own clock.
#   the stage-      `.stage-health.json` (lib/stage-health.sh, agent-ops#662)
#   health snapshot  is excluded as a raw file for the same reason
#                   `.doctor-status.json` is — a peer's copy of the file
#                   itself would answer for a computation nobody there ran —
#                   but this verdict does need to reach peers, which is the
#                   whole point of #662: a fleet dashboard that can only see
#                   this node's own stages is no better than `--status` run
#                   locally. So its *content* travels a different way, the
#                   same one `compose`/`image`/`switch` already use below:
#                   folded into `heartbeat.json`, this node's own verdict
#                   about itself, published like any other fact only this
#                   node can state. `.doctor-status.json`'s own *verdict*
#                   travels the identical way as of agent-ops#1278:
#                   lib/pager.sh's `verdict-unanimous` invariant is the first
#                   reader anywhere that needs a peer's doctor verdict, not
#                   only this node's own. As of agent-ops#1397 a *bounded*
#                   `fails` travels with it — the first three entries, each
#                   truncated — because a verdict with no failing check named
#                   sent someone node-hunting for `.doctor-status.json` by
#                   hand to learn what every node was already saying (#1398).
#                   Bounded is the whole point, and the reason the array did
#                   not travel before: unbounded diagnostic prose in a file
#                   the whole fleet re-fetches every
#                   `schedule.state_sync_fetch_minutes` is a cost with no
#                   ceiling, whereas three truncated lines are the smallest
#                   thing that names the check. `warns`/`skips` stay local —
#                   nothing off-node reads them — and so does `token_expiry`,
#                   because a credential's expiry date has no reader off the
#                   node that holds the credential.
#   the stage       `*.stream.jsonl` is a stage's whole event stream, every
#   streams          message and every tool result (lib/stage-run.sh). It is
#                   local forensics and, while the stage runs, its liveness
#                   signal — neither of which is a fact about this node that
#                   a peer needs. The size is what makes it a hard exclusion
#                   rather than a preference: a stage's `.out` is one JSON
#                   object, but its stream runs to megabytes, and the mirror
#                   holds `cycles_retained` cycles across four branches with
#                   the whole history in git. What a peer reads — the result
#                   envelope — is published as `<stage>.out` exactly as
#                   before.
#   the fleet-log   `.fleet-log.jsonl` is the union of every node's
#   snapshot         `log.jsonl` as one cycle saw it, materialised into that
#                   cycle's own directory (`fleet_logs`, lib/fleet.sh) and
#                   read only by the cycle that wrote it. Publishing it would
#                   send a peer a derivative of the very logs it is already
#                   being sent — and one copy of it per retained cycle,
#                   `cycles_retained` of them, each the size of the whole
#                   fleet's history to that point (agent-ops#763).
#   .git            the mirror's own repository, which lives at the same root.
#
# Everything else — log.jsonl, review-log.jsonl, revert-rate.jsonl, cycles/,
# reviews/, disabled.json, the cron logs — is the node's contribution to the
# fleet's memory and is published.
#

# --- The mirror's own index lock (agent-ops#1377) ------------------------------
# `$mirror.lock` above serialises this script's runs; `.git/index.lock` is
# git's, taken by every command that writes the index and left behind by one
# that died mid-write — a container stopped under it, a git the kernel
# OOM-killed. Nothing ever examined it, so on poetic-1 (2026-09-09 to -11, 27
# hours) and poetic-2 (2026-09-13 to -15, three days) every push failed at
# the first index write with `fatal: Unable to create '…/.git/index.lock':
# File exists`, while the push step's own progress lines kept printing, the
# node kept cycling, `--status` read every stage `ok`, and the only node-side
# voice was the doctor's hourly publication check (#602), into a file nothing
# surfaced.
#
# The lock is cleared when three things hold: it exists; it is older than one
# push interval (`schedule.state_sync_push_minutes` — the interval this very
# script runs on, and a live git holds the index lock for seconds, so one
# older than the gap between two pushes belongs to a process that is not
# coming back); and no git process is working in the mirror right now. That
# last is read from /proc rather than inferred from the flock, because a git
# run by hand inside the container, or a gc that detached, is not a state-sync
# run and holds no `$mirror.lock`. Where /proc cannot be read the answer is

# backgrounded and killed as a unit the way a function call can.
#
# A single file's redaction failing here — permission denied, the file
# vanished between `find`'s stat and `sed -i`'s open, disk full mid-rewrite —
# used to end the whole loop under `set -e`: the loop was `do_push`'s own
# top-level code, not a condition, so `errexit` unwound the run the instant
# `redact_file` returned non-zero, abandoning the read side of `find`'s
# process substitution before it reached EOF. Bash does not close that
# pipe's read end when a loop exits early — only the shell's own exit does —
# so `find`, part-way through mirroring 339 MB of state on ockham-2 on
# 2026-09-18, blocked writing into a pipe nothing was reading any more, and
# the shell's own `set -e` exit blocked in turn waiting to reap it before it
# could close that pipe and free it: an unwind and an unconsumed process
# substitution deadlocking each other, the seven-hour wedge agent-ops#1679
# reports (the exact trigger — which file, which error — was not recovered
# from the incident; this closes the general hazard the loop's own shape
# creates, whatever specific error trips it). A failed redaction no longer
# unwinds the run where it happens, but nor does it let the file through as
# it stands
# (agent-ops#1703, the owner's ruling on agent-ops#1698's own open question):
# a `redact_file` failure now cascades — `rm -f` the file out of the mirror
# first, since a skipped file costs this node one push interval of its own
# visibility while a secret-shaped string committed to a never-rotated
# repository costs it forever (agent-ops#966). Where the mirror copy sits
# under a directory `sed -i`'s own write-a-temp-file-and-rename could not
# write into either — the removal `rm -f` needs is the same directory
# permission — truncating the file in place is tried next, since that needs
# only the file's own write permission, which `rsync -a` carried over
# unchanged and unrelated to its directory's. Only a file that resists
# every one of these — content survives redaction, removal and truncation
# alike — abandons the push by returning non-zero, which the caller already
# turns into a `state_sync_push_failed` event exactly as a deadline timeout
# does (below): nothing this pass could not rewrite ever reaches the branch
# with its content intact. That last step leaves `find` mid-stream, which
# looks like the shape of the wedge above but is not its mechanism: that one
# was an `errexit` unwind blocked waiting to reap `find` before it could
# close the pipe, whereas a plain `return` lets the shell carry on and this
# function's own subshell — the caller runs it as a background job — exit
# immediately behind it, closing the read end so `find` dies on the broken
# pipe instead of blocking on it. The caller's own deadline still stands

  # The heartbeat is why every push moves the branch: it is what lets the
  # fleet dashboard tell a quiet node from a dead one — on a standby (which
  # has no cycles to publish) it is the entire point of the push.
  #
  # It also carries the node's version (lib/version.sh), for the same reason it
  # carries the role: a peer publishes no container and no checkout, so what
  # code it is running is knowable to the rest of the fleet only if it says so
  # itself. Since a roll defers while a cycle is in flight, nodes are routinely
  # on different images, and a dashboard that could not tell them apart could
  # not answer whether a fix had reached the node that needed it.
  #
  # And the compose-drift verdict (lib/compose-drift.sh), on the same
  # reasoning one layer down: the node's compose.yaml lives on its host,
  # where no image roll can update it and nothing but that node can read it
  # (issue #131). The node is the only party that can say whether its own
  # deployment file has fallen behind, so it says so here.
  #
  # And the image-drift verdict (lib/image-drift.sh), for the gap #155
  # writes up: a fleet that is uniformly stale looks identical to a healthy
  # one when nodes are only ever compared with each other, so the verdict
  # against the registry — the one party that actually knows what "newest"
  # means — travels here too. Its cache file lives beside the state this
  # push already reads and is excluded above like the other local caches;
  # sharing it with scripts/publish-dashboard.sh's own reads means the two
  # never pay for the same registry query twice inside its TTL.
  #
  # And the node-scoped switch (lib/toggle.sh's `toggle_switch_summary`,
  # issue #379). Unlike compose.yaml, `disabled.json` itself does replicate
  # in the push below — but a record is not a verdict: whether it is still in
  # force is decided against a clock, and a reader working that out from the
  # replicated file would be a second implementation of the switch, free to
  # disagree with what this node's own `--status` says (requirement 34a). So
  # what travels is the verdict this node reached, through the same call the
  # dashboard's page-top banner reads. The fleet-wide switch needs none of
  # this: it is a flag every node fetches for itself
  # (`fleet/disabled.json`).
  #
  # And the per-stage health verdict (lib/stage-health.sh, agent-ops#662), on
  # the identical shape: `agent-cycle.sh`'s own cleanup already computed and
  # persisted it to `.stage-health.json` this cycle, so what is read here is
  # that finished verdict, not a second computation over this node's log —
  # the file is `null` on a node that has not completed a cycle since
  # upgrading, which the dashboard already renders as no data rather than as
  # healthy.
  #
  # And the mirror-rebuild verdict (lib/mirror-integrity.sh's
  # `mirror_rebuild_verdict`, issue #604): `null` until `mirror_init` above
  # has ever had to discard and rebuild this checkout, else
  # {status:"rebuilt", count, last_rebuilt_at}. A corrupt mirror silently
  # self-healing on every tick would hide a disk that is quietly damaging it
  # on a schedule; publishing the verdict, and bumping `count` on every
  # further rebuild rather than reading the same as the first, is what makes
  # a repeat visible instead of indistinguishable noise.
  #
  # And the updater verdict (lib/updater-health.sh, agent-ops#603):
  # `deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh` keys its ledger by `$HOSTNAME` —
  # the container's own identity, the same one it stamps into `lock.json`
  # (`host: $host` above `held_by`'s foreign-lock branch) — never by
  # `node_name`, which is `NODE_NAME` or a bare `hostname` fallback and may
  # name the same node under a friendlier string than the container Docker
  # actually created. Reading the ledger under `node_name` here would ask
  # for a file the hook never wrote, and read every node as "not applicable"
  # for ever. `null` until this node has ever been polled by the hook, or —
  # on a fresh roll — for the short window before the replacement's own
  # first poll lands (agent-ops#603, "at least these states" is deliberate:
  # a container that has just been told to go ahead is not yet either
  # rolled or stuck).
  # Newest cycle id. Sliced in bash rather than piped into `head -n 1`, for
  # the reason kept_cycles sets out — and this is the site where it mattered:
  # a command substitution in the current shell, under `set -euo pipefail`, so
  # `sort`'s SIGPIPE became the push's own exit status. `do_push` died here,
  # after taking the mirror lock and fetching but before committing anything,
  # writing not one line to state-sync.log. Measured at 17 of 30 runs on
  # `ockham-container` and 16 of 30 on `ockham-2`: a node replicated its state
  # every 11-20 minutes against the `*/5` the cron entry asks for, and the
  # only evidence anywhere was supercronic's `exit status 141` (#806).
