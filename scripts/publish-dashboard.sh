# lock.json, cron.log) plus live GitHub data (via gh), and writes a single
# self-contained data file (data.js) next to a copy of the dashboard's
# index.html under <state_dir>/dashboard/. Open that index.html in a browser
# to view the dashboard — no server, no open port, nothing leaves the machine.

# deliberate exception (agent-ops#1278): a WITH_GITHUB (full) tick also
# evaluates lib/pager.sh's fleet-level invariants, which may file or close a
# GitHub issue and append a `pager-*` transition event to this node's own
# log.jsonl — the one write this script makes to the pipeline's own state.

# --- The no-op short-circuit (#787) -------------------------------------------
# The Publisher is a pure function of its inputs, and the heartbeat asks it for
# an answer every five seconds. On an idle node every one of those answers is
# the last answer: on 2026-08-25 this script cost 18.1s per tick against the
# 5-second budget publish-dashboard-launcher.sh budgets for, ran back-to-back
# for the whole window because of it, and produced a byte-identical 1.45 MB
# data.js roughly fourteen times in a row — the only delta between consecutive
# payloads being their own clock fields. Two idle nodes held two of six cores.
#
# So the same rule the Co-Ordinator has (lib/noop-skip.sh, requirement 3b):
# if nothing this script reads has moved since it last published, publishing
# again buys the same bytes at the same price.
#
# lib/noop-skip.sh is emphatic that a fingerprint missing an input is this
# system's signature failure — no error, just a page that quietly stops
# updating. Two properties are what make this instance safe where that warning
# applies hardest:
#
#   1. It covers by *exclusion*, not by enumeration. Everything under the state
#      dir and the peers dir counts, minus this script's own two outputs. A new
#      input added by a later panel is therefore covered on the day it is added,
#      with nobody having to remember this rule exists — the failure direction
#      of a mistake here is a needless rebuild, never a stale page.
#   2. A GitHub tick never skips. The launcher forces one about every five
#      minutes (LAUNCHER_GITHUB_MAX_AGE), so even a fingerprint that is wrong
#      in the dangerous direction can only hold a stale page until the next
#      one — which is the cadence the dashboard published at before the
#      sub-minute heartbeat existed at all (#26), and well inside the hours
#      that `lock_stale_after` reasons in.
#
# The skipped ticks are counted rather than logged. Logging each one would
# replace fourteen "wrote" lines per window with fourteen "skipped" lines and
# save nobody anything; the count instead rides the next real publish, where it
# is the one number that says this rule is working.
fingerprint_file="$state_dir/.dashboard-fingerprint"
skips_file="$state_dir/.dashboard-skips"
# The last full payload, for a fast build to carry the history roll-ups forward
# from. Deliberately not named `.dashboard-*.json`: that glob is content-hashed
# into the fingerprint, and a file this script rewrites on every full build
# would then invalidate the very no-op skip it sits beside — the self-reference
# that cost #801 and #803.
payload_cache="$state_dir/.dashboard-payload"
# No usable carry-forward means this is a full build, whatever was asked for.
# The fallback direction is time, never truth: a needless full build costs one
# slow tick, where publishing a merge over a truncated cache would put a
# half-empty page on every dashboard in the fleet.

  {
    # `-prune` on the served directory and on the heartbeat log the launcher

    # publishing, so counting them would make every fingerprint differ from
    # the one the same state produced a moment earlier, and nothing would ever
    # skip.
    #
    # Two more classes of path must not contribute an *mtime*, and the
    # difference between them decides how each is handled. The failure modes
    # are not symmetric: leaving a non-input in costs a wasted rebuild, while
    # leaving a real input out would leave the page stale, which is the failure
    # lib/noop-skip.sh exists to warn about. So prune only what is
    # demonstrably never read, and for anything that *is* read, downgrade it
    # from mtime to content rather than dropping it.
    #
    #   not read at all — other cron entries' logs and error sidecars:
    #     state-sync.log, doctor.log, tech-debt-archive.log, fleet-cache/*.err,
    #     *.repo-err. Anchored with -path, not -name, so a same-named file
    #     inside a cycle directory is not caught by accident. revert-rate.log
    #     needs no prune of its own: every write to it lands beside a write to
    #     revert-rate.jsonl, which already forces the rebuild a stale
    #     revert-rate panel would need — excluding it would save nothing.
    #     tech-debt-archive.log has no such structured sibling under
    #     state_dir at all (what it publishes lands in the state repository's
    #     own tech-debt-archive/ tree, never here), so without its own prune
    #     every daily run would force one rebuild nothing on the page needs.
    #
    #   read, but rewritten on a timer with normally identical content:
    #     .image-drift-cache.json, .doctor-status.json, .dashboard-*.json and
    #     fleet-cache/*.json. Their mtimes move while their meaning does not —
    #     fleet-cache/ every ~90 seconds, which on its own guaranteed that no
    #     tick could ever skip (#803). Hashed by content below; the whole set
    #     is a few hundred KB, a few milliseconds against a ~20s rebuild.
    #
    # `.image-drift-cache.json` was the first of these found (#801) and was
    # fixed alone, which is why this needed a second pass: the question to ask
    # of a self-invalidating key is not "which file did this" but "what else
    # behaves the same way".
    #
    # `-type f` for the same reason one level up: replacing any file in a
    # directory moves that directory's own mtime, so counting directory entries
    # re-introduces exactly the self-reference the prunes above remove. Nothing
    # is lost — a file appearing, changing or vanishing is already visible as a
    # file, and an empty directory cannot change what the page renders.

# --- Recent cycle ids, newest first, fleet-wide -------------------------------
# One "<id>\t<cycles-dir>" line per known cycle: ours (from the local dir and
# the union's event stream — an id only in events renders from its events
# alone), and each fetched peer's (from its materialised cycles/). Ids begin
# with a UTC timestamp, so one reverse sort interleaves every node's history
# into fleet time order; MAX_CYCLES then caps the *fleet-wide* detail list,
# which is what keeps data.js near its single-node size however many nodes
# report (the transcripts are the bytes that matter).
# The middle column ranks the source: D rows point at a directory that
# really holds the cycle's transcripts, E rows are ids known only from the
# event stream (pruned locally, or a peer's that predates its fetch). Sorting
# id-desc then D-before-E and keeping the first row per id means an id that
# exists on disk always renders from the right node's directory — without
# the ranking, the union's E row for a peer's cycle could win and silently
# strip its stages.
# Only ids of the pipelines' own shape become rows. The log also carries
# records no cycle produced — a hand-appended `unvoided` or `limit-hit` uses
# the `cycle: "manual"` sentinel (implementation spec 33) — and every such
# record, from every node, for all time, collapses into one id here. That id
# has no cycle-start, no cycle-end and no transcript directory, so it renders
# as a cycle that began at the first hand-edit anyone ever made and can never
# end; worse, the sort above is lexical, and "manual" beats every digit, so it
# pins itself to the top of Recent cycles and holds a MAX_CYCLES slot forever.
# Dropping it here rather than in the page keeps it in the log tail, where a
# record that is not a cycle belongs, and keeps the limit and void readers —
# which filter on the event, never on the cycle — untouched.

# rather than left to read as a second Reviewer. Any other stem passes through
# verbatim: an actor added upstream should show up unlabelled rather than
# vanish into the totals.
# Each row also carries `ts` — the cycle/review id's own timestamp
# (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-…`, always UTC) reformatted to a plain ISO 8601 instant —
# alongside the coarser `day` bucket the charts already group by. `day` alone
# can only ever answer "which GMT calendar day", which is exactly what issue
# #186 found not obvious: a reader in any other zone sees a "today" that
# doesn't match their own clock. `ts` is null for a row whose directory name
# doesn't match the expected shape (a hand-placed or future format change)
# rather than a guess, so a malformed name drops out of `recent_costs` below
# without corrupting the totals that never depended on it.
#
# `cost_rows` (issue #334) is the per-(transcript × model) breakdown of this
# same set, trimmed to {day, model, actor, usd, cycle} — un-summed, so the
# page can re-aggregate the model/actor breakdowns over whatever time frame
# the reader picks instead of only the whole COST_SCAN_DAYS window
# `by_day`/`by_model`/`by_actor` are fixed to. `cycle` carries the same
# transcript's cost across the (possibly several) model rows it now
# contributes: the model chart's windowed `n` wants a count of rows (one per
# model a transcript touched, matching `by_model.n` below) but the actor
# chart's wants a count of transcripts (one per `.out` file, matching
# `by_actor.n` below) — without `cycle` the client cannot tell those two
# counts apart once a transcript spans more than one model, and a reader who
# narrows the time-frame selector would see an actor's "stage run(s)" figure
# inflated by however many of its transcripts touched two models. `models[]`
# below is one entry per `modelUsage` key,
# each carrying that model's own `costUSD` (issue #536): a transcript's whole
# `total_cost_usd` is not one model's spend, subagent calls routinely add a
# second (typically a cheaper model dispatched inside the same invocation),
# and crediting all of it to whichever key `keys[0]` names credited every
# subagent's spend to that one alphabetically-first model — systematically
# Haiku, since it sorts before Opus and Sonnet. Summing `models[].usd` back up
# reproduces `total_cost_usd` to the cent. `select(.value | type == "object")`
# mirrors `lib/metering.sh`'s own `tokens` derivation: a `modelUsage` entry
# that isn't an object (seen in the wild as a bare number) would make `.value
# .costUSD` a hard jq error, taking a parseable envelope's whole row down with
# it, so it is skipped rather than fatal. An empty or unreadable `modelUsage`
# falls back to one `unknown` entry carrying the transcript's whole cost, so

# --- Actor and model scorecards (issue #610, D22) -----------------------------
# One card per actor with a model choice (D12) — coordinator, implementer,
# reviewer, enabler, refiner — one row per model and tier within each,
# graded on outcome rather than activity. Supersedes the Co-Ordinator
# verdict-quality panel (issue #319, folded into the Co-Ordinator's own row's
# `measure` below rather than left rendering beside it) and subsumes the two
# "model used" pies (issue #529: their ratio is now one facet of a row —
# `attempts`/`clean` per model and tier — rather than a chart of their own).
# The Approver is not one of these five: its own verdict/fate divergence is
# already tracked on its own terms by `scripts/verdict-fate-report.sh`
# (D18/agent-ops#573) and is not folded into this card.
#
# The join key is `{repo, item}` (`item_key` below), the same one every other
# reader of this log uses (`lib/cycle-state.sh`, `scripts/pickup-metrics.sh`,
# `lib/item-lifecycle.sh`). Three sources feed it, each read exactly once:
#
#   attempts/clean   every `stage-end` for that actor's stage name(s)
#                    (requirement 33), whether or not it carries an item —
#                    the Co-Ordinator's own engagement and the Enabler's and
#                    Refiner's top-level ones never do (they span several
#                    items), so counting only the item-carrying subset would
#                    undercount exactly those three actors' own attempts.
#                    `clean` is a stage-end with no `kill_reason` (requirement
#                    4e); a fleet-wide crash-loop escalation (the other half
#                    of `stage-rerun`, docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md) cannot be pinned to
#                    one attempt among several and is not subtracted here.
#   terminal fate    joined through `lib/item-lifecycle.sh`'s own fold
#                    (requirement 49) — never re-derived — restricted to the
#                    subset of stage-ends above that *do* carry `{repo, item}`
#                    (Implementer, Reviewer, and the Enabler's two per-item
#                    adjudication stages; the Co-Ordinator's and the top-level
#                    Enabler's/Refiner's own engagements still cannot join
#                    here, on the same grounds as `attempts` above — their own
#                    measures below are built from their own per-item events
#                    instead: `selection` for the Co-Ordinator, `item-refined`
#                    for the Refiner).
#   rework           `rework` events (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md), deduped first-by-
#                    ts over `{repo, item, class}` (`{repo, item, class,
#                    evidence.by}` for `post-merge-revert`) per that
#                    document's own "Do not double-count" rule before anything
#                    is counted from them. `post-merge-revert`'s own `item` is
#                    the reverted *pull request*'s number, not the work item a
#                    stage-end names, so it is re-keyed onto the work item via
#                    `pr_url` (`pr-raised`/`pr-ready` already carry both) before
#                    the join below, or left unjoined (and so excluded from
#                    every row) when no such mapping is on record.
#
# Cost and wall-clock per landed item read the landed stage-end's own
# `cost_usd`/`duration_ms` (requirement 33a) directly, not
# `counts.cost_rows[]`: that field is deliberately never `attributed` for the
# Enabler or the Refiner (docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md — it shares its triggering
# cycle's id with whichever stage of that cycle owns the item), which would
# leave those two actors' rows permanently null, whereas the metering record
# already carries the exact invocation's own total (subagents included) keyed
# to the item its own stage-end names — a sound join `cost_rows` cannot offer
# for two of these five actors and needs no re-deriving for the other three.
#
# **Stratify or abstain** (D22): each row's stratum is its own `model` and
# `tier` — Implementer splits `trivial`/`default`, Reviewer `default`/
# `complex`, Enabler `default`/`critical` by its stage name
# (`enabler`/`enabler-adjudicate`+`enabler-decide`); the Co-Ordinator and the
# Refiner each have one configured model and so one tier, `default`. A model
# id matching neither of an actor's two *currently* configured tier values —
# a historical run under a since-changed mapping — reads `unmapped` rather
# than a guess; there is no per-stage-end record of which config key resolved
# it at the time, only the model id it resolved to. Every row states its own
# `sample` (the closed population its rate is computed over — `landed` +
# `voided` + `abandoned`; the Co-Ordinator's, Reviewer's, Refiner's and
# Enabler's own further `measure` block states its own sample, since each is
# a different population) and its `status` — `insufficient-sample` below
# `SCORECARD_MIN_SAMPLE`, reusing `lib/verdict-fate.sh`'s own convention
# (agent-ops#573) and its default of 5 rather than inventing a second
# threshold. The gate is display-side: a row below the minimum still carries
# its computed rate(s) here, for a consumer of this aggregate other than the
# page, and it is the page that reads "insufficient evidence" in their place
# rather than ranking on too little evidence.

# --- Blocked and void items (requirements 34, 34c, 34h) ----------------------
# Both rules live in lib/cycle-state.sh, shared with agent-cycle.sh, so what the
# dashboard calls blocked or void is by construction what the Co-Ordinator is
# told. Only the projection for display is local. They are shown apart because
# they mean opposite things to a human deciding whether to intervene: a blocked
# item is waiting on something, a void item is finished with.
#
# Which is why the blocked list is `open_blocked_items` and not `blocked_items`:
# an item can carry both marks, and one that does is void (requirement 34h).
# Every `void` verdict the Enabler reaches leaves the block that preceded it
# standing — `item-void` clears nothing — so listing the raw blocked set here
# put items in *both* tables, in the one panel whose whole purpose is to keep
# the two apart, and left them there for as long as the log remembered them.

# thing about a blocked row an operator most needs at a glance: their own name on
# an open issue, or the pipeline's last verdict if it is still the pipeline's
# move. Only marks newer than the block count, so a re-blocked item does not
# inherit the resolved escalation of an older one.
#
# The rows arrive on stdin ahead of the events, never as an `--argjson`
# (requirement 4g): the blocked extract grows with the fleet's history, and this
# guard would swallow an `execve` past MAX_ARG_STRLEN as an empty enrichment —
# every escalation and Enabler verdict silently dropped from a panel that still

# --- What each node is doing (requirement 33 / 2.5) ---------------------------
# `status.current` above answers "what is being worked on right now" for one
# node — this node, off its own live lock. A fleet has no single answer, so the
# same question is answered once per node here and rendered on that node's card.
#
# A peer publishes no lock (state-sync excludes it: a copied lock is a lock no
# process holds), but it does publish its log, and requirement 33 stamps `node`
# on every event. So a peer's state is derived exactly as the local one is,
# from its own most recent cycle: running until that cycle logs `cycle-end`,
# the live stage being the last `stage-start` with no matching `stage-end`, and
# the work whatever its Co-Ordinator selected. What that cannot see is a node
# killed mid-cycle, which leaves a `cycle-start` with no end and so goes on
# looking busy for ever; the page bounds the claim with the heartbeat's
# freshness and `lock_stale_after`, rather than the derivation asserting more

# be built from the local clock and a hardcoded `false`, which is exactly what
# read fresh for four days on 2026-08-08 while this node's own state-sync push
# was failing the whole time. Both rows are now read back from what the shared
# state actually holds — self's from `.state-sync-published.json`
# (state-sync.sh's `do_fetch`, which reads back this node's own branch the
# same fetch already brought down), a peer's from its `heartbeat.json` —
# against the same configured threshold (`node_stale_after_minutes`, three
# missed heartbeat/fetch cycles by default), so anything older means missed
# pushes or missed fetches and the entry is flagged stale rather than silently
# trusted. `state_repo` unset is single-node operation (requirement 2.5):
# there is no shared state to have gone stale against, so self stays
# definitionally fresh exactly as before.
#
# Each row also carries the node's `version` (lib/version.sh) — the code that
# node is running, ours read directly and a peer's from the heartbeat it
# published. A fleet is routinely mid-update, because a roll defers while a

  # --- Merge-queue awareness (agent-ops#374, #375; D17) ------------------------
  # lib/merge-queue.sh's merge_queue_probe is the one place that knows how to
  # ask GitHub whether a pull request is currently queued — shared with
  # scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh (requirement 38f) rather than
  # reimplemented here. Only non-draft pull requests are probed: GitHub will
  # not enqueue a draft, so one is never worth the call. The set probed is
  # exactly this tick's open, labelled pull requests — bounded by
  # `max_open_agent_prs` per repo, so unlike the pull-request index or the
  # tech-debt register (forty-odd references, budgeted a few a tick) this
  # never needs a miss budget of its own.
  #
  # "Dequeued" is this Publisher's own memory (`queue_cache`) of whether a
  # pull request has fallen out of the queue since it was last seen queued,
  # not the probe's own timeline read (`dequeued_at`/`dequeue_reason`): that
  # field is the *last* removal event regardless of age or of a later
  # re-queue (agent-ops#394's open follow-up on the same probe), which is the
  # wrong signal for a badge that must both persist until a human deals with
  # it and clear the moment the pull request is queued again. So the warning
  # is a small state machine kept in `queue_cache`, one entry per pull
  # request, `{queued, warn}`: `warn` is set the tick `queued` is observed to
  # flip from true to false, stays set on every later tick that still reads
  # not-queued (a maintainer glancing at the page between heartbeats must

# --- everything to the matching `fi` is a full-build-only roll-up: it reads
# the fleet's whole history, and a fast tick carries the last full answer
# forward from the payload cache instead. Left unindented so the diff that
# introduced the tier stays readable against the code it wraps (#798).
# --- The autonomous-landing digest (D18 WI-8, agent-ops#411) -----------------
# Risk 6 of the autonomy investigation ("overnight merges with nobody
# watching") is accepted deliberately, on the stated condition that this
# replaces the synchronous landing gate at `human` with an asynchronous audit:
# the queue re-tests, `failed-runs` turns post-merge breakage back into
# selectable work, and this section is where a human sees, once a day,
# everything the Script landed without them. It is permanent, not rollout
# scaffolding — at `agent-merges-all` it is the *only* routine account of what
# merged.
#
# Built from the fleet-wide event union, never from a private counter, so a
# landing armed on any node appears on every node's dashboard. Three parts:
#
#   armed    — one row per `landing-armed` inside the window, joined to the
#              `landing-audit-record` (requirement 8x, agent-ops#578) that
#              `_landing_stage_attempt` wrote at the same moment it armed —
#              its tier and verdict are the audit's whole point: "which model
#              tier passed this, and did it approve or merely not refuse" —
#              and, where GitHub has been read this tick, to the pull
#              request's own title and state.
#   refused  — the counterpart the digest would lie by omitting. A day with
#              two landings and forty refusals is a classifier holding the
#              line; the same two landings with no refusals is a gate that
#              may not be running at all, and those must not look alike.
#   budget   — per repository, `merge_budget_per_day`'s effective cap against
#              the rolling-24h count `lib/merge-budget.sh` itself last read,
#              its status (`ok`/`held`/`frozen`), and — held or frozen — the
#              oldest waiting pull request and (`frozen` only) why, so an
#              operator can tell "the fleet is idle because there is no work"
#              from "the fleet is idle because the governor closed hours ago"
#              without a live read of the freeze flag on this tick.
#
# The join is by `pr_url` and the arming cycle, and is deliberately
# first-write-wins over that cycle's audit records *at or after* the arm:
# `_landing_stage_attempt` writes `landing-armed` first and
# `landing-audit-record` second, moments apart from the same function call,
# so this never has to reach further than the earliest match at or after the
# arm's own ts. `landing-armed` carries no pointer of its own to the record
# that follows it, so the cycle `log_event` stamps on both stands in for one
# — which is what keeps a *second* arm of the same pull request from being
# answered by the wrong cycle's record. A `landing-armed` with no
# matching record at all — an event from before requirement 8x shipped, or a
# write this process died between the two log_event calls for — is
# `anomaly: true`: reported, never silently dropped nor rendered with nulls
# as though the join had simply come up empty. This is the one property WI-8
# existed to promise and, before requirement 8x, could not always keep: every
# landing this digest shows is either fully explained or flagged as
# unexplained, never quietly incomplete. A pre-8x `landing-armed` can still
# have its tier/verdict explained, even though it stays `anomaly: true`
# forever (it genuinely has no audit record) — the older `approver-verdict`
# join this panel used before requirement 8x lives on purely as that
# fallback, so "the record could not be found" and "the record said so" stay
# distinguishable without also going back to reading every landing's
# tier/verdict as `unknown` for events this old.
# Both inputs travel by file, not argv: `github_json` carries every open pull
# request the fleet knows about and is exactly the kind of value requirement
# 4g's MAX_ARG_STRLEN rule exists for (see the note above the assemble call).
# The configured caps below are a fallback only, for a repository this tick
# has never yet seen a `merge_budget_decide` result for — they are not derived
# by sourcing lib/merge-budget.sh, whose `merge_budget_effective_cap` also
# consults the freeze flag over the network, a read this script has no
# business making on a dashboard tick. The precedence is the same one that
# file documents: the repository's own entry, else the top-level key, else
# the shipped default of 8.
#
# The per-repository `budget` block itself (D18 issue #574) is sourced from
# the event log, never recomputed: `landing-armed` (an `arm`), `merge-budget-
# hold` (a `hold`) and `merge-budget-frozen` (a `hold` that was also an
# anomaly) each carry the `cap`/`count` `merge_budget_decide` actually read at
# that decision — the same rolling-24h count `lib/merge-budget.sh` itself
# counts, never a private one — so the *single latest* of the three for a
# repository, across the whole log rather than only this digest's own window
# (the same "not restricted to the window" reasoning `$audit_records` above
# already uses), is that repository's state *as of that last gate-5 decision* — not a
# live read, and unbounded in age: a repository whose backlog is empty, or
# whose candidates all fail eligibility before reaching gate 5, keeps
# whatever event last fired indefinitely. `ok` means the last thing gate 5
# did for it was arm, and its `consumed` is the count `merge_budget_decide`
# read *before* granting that arm (the landing the arm itself produced is not
# in it, so a repository that just spent its last permitted landing this
# window reads e.g. 7/8, not 8/8) — but that count is a rolling-24h fact
# exactly like a hold's, and is aged back the same way: once its own event
# falls outside this digest's window, `consumed` resets to unmeasured rather
# than carrying a count forward that has already rolled off the governor's
# own clock, whatever the number would otherwise claim. `held` means
# exhausted, no anomaly, and is aged back to `ok` on the identical rule — a
# hold is a rolling-24h fact, so one nothing has refreshed for a full window
# has already rolled off the governor's own clock — and its `consumed`
# resets to unmeasured with it, so an aged hold reads exactly like a
# repository gate 5 has never reached rather than carrying a stale count
# forward under a status that now claims to be healthy. `frozen` means an
# anomaly tripped it to `agent-approves`, and is never aged back this way: a
# freeze stands until a human clears the fleet flag, not until time passes,
# so staying stuck is correct even indefinitely. A `held`/`frozen` row's
# `as_of` carries the source event's own timestamp for the page to render an
# age against; an `ok` row never carries `as_of`, aged back or not — once its
# count resets to unmeasured its status, consumed and as_of read as a
# repository gate 5 has never reached at all reads, which has no age to show
# either. Only `cap` still separates the two: a row with any recorded decision
# keeps that decision's own cap until its next decision refreshes it, never
# re-reading config.json, so an operator's edit to `merge_budget_per_day`

# about to bind (requirement 2.0's own gate) before the first `guard-degraded`
# refusal, not after.
#
#   - `latest` is the newest `readable: true` event, by its own `ts` — never
#     windowed, since the point of the "meter gone quiet" badge below is
#     noticing a *stale* latest reading, which a 24h window would silently
#     drop instead of reporting.
#   - `per_hour` is trailing 24h only (`.ts[0:13]`, matching the report
#     script's own `hour` grouping): readings, the peak `core.used` among
#     that hour's readable readings, the `guard-degraded` refusal count
#     (`is_refusal`) and the requirement-2.0 stand-down count
#     (`is_budget_standdown`) — both predicates copied verbatim from
#     scripts/github-budget-report.sh so the two can never disagree about
#     what counts as either.
#   - `about_to_bind` is null with no readable reading to judge, else true
#     when `latest`'s core or graphql remaining is below its configured
#     floor — the identical `remaining < floor` comparison
#     `github_limit_verdict` makes, so a `0` floor (disabled) can never trip
#     it, the same as the gate it mirrors.
#   - `quiet` is null on a genuinely empty log (nothing to judge yet), else
#     true when no readable reading falls inside the last two configured
#     cycle intervals.
#   - `readings: 0` (with every other field null-shaped) is the card's own
#     empty state — no `github-budget` event anywhere in the log union — kept
#     distinct from the degrade-to-null path below, which means the roll-up
#     itself could not be assembled.
