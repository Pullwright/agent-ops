# gather-register-status.sh — what a repository's tech-debt register says about
# specific items, on its default branch (requirement 34i).
#
# Given a repo slug, its default branch and one or more item ids, print a JSON
# object mapping each id it could resolve *with certainty* to that item's
# `status` field:
#
#   {"TD-PPpfid-26072401": "resolved", "TD26071805": "resolved"}
#
# Usage: gather-register-status.sh <owner/repo> <default-branch> <id> [<id>…]
#
# ## Only the ids asked for, and only when they are blocked
#
# This is not a whole-register reader — nothing in the pipeline is, now that
# the frozen archive has no checker walking it. This
# answers one question about a handful of named items — "is this one still
# work?" — and the Script calls it only for the blocked items whose ids are
# register ids, which is nearly always none. A fleet with no blocked register
# items spends nothing here: no ids, no call.
#
# ## Certainty, and what happens without it
#
# An id resolves only when exactly one item file's own frontmatter claims it,
# by `id` or by `legacy-id` (a block recorded before a register migration names
# the item by the id it had at the time, and that id survives as `legacy-id` —
# `docs/TECH-DEBT-REGISTER.md` in Poetic-Poems/poetic). The filename is a
# shortlist, never the answer: two files could end in the same date-and-sequence
# digits, and a block cleared off the wrong item's status is a block cleared out
# from under real work.
#
# Everything short of that certainty is simply absent from the output — an
# unreadable register, a 404, an id that matches no file or more than one, a
# file with no `status`. The caller (`lib/work-gone.sh`) treats absence as "not
# known to be gone" and leaves the item blocked, so every failure mode here
# costs a delay, never a false clearance. That is the opposite of
# `gather-findings.sh`'s degradation rule, and deliberately so: its `[]` is read
# by a Co-Ordinator that then declines, while this output is read as evidence.
#
# Never exits non-zero: it always prints a valid object. A gatherer that aborted
# the cycle would make a tidy-up a reliability risk.
