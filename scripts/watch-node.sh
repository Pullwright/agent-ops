# watch-node.sh — watch a running node's pipeline output, without needing to
# know the docker-exec incantation by heart.
#
# Usage:
#   watch-node.sh cron   [-f]
#   watch-node.sh events [-f]
#
#   cron    the node's cron log  (cron.log)  — one line per tick, including
#           the standby ones
#   events  the node's cycle log (log.jsonl) — cycle starts, selections, PRs
#           raised, stand-downs; see docs/spec/implementation/README.md
#           (requirement 33) for event types and fields
#   -f      follow, like `tail -f`, instead of printing the last 50 lines and
#           exiting
#
# Run this from the node's stack directory — wherever its compose.yaml and
# .env live, see deploy/docker/README.md — or set STACK_DIR to point at it
# from anywhere else.
#
# Read-only: this wraps `docker compose exec -T scheduler tail` and nothing
# more, so it is safe to allow-list wholesale — for an interactive agent, in
# place of the ad-hoc docker-exec commands it replaces.

usage: watch-node.sh cron|events [-f]

  cron    the node's cron log   (/home/agent/.local/state/poetic-agents/cron.log)
  events  the node's cycle log  (/home/agent/.local/state/poetic-agents/log.jsonl)
  -f      follow, like tail -f, instead of printing the last 50 lines and exiting

Run from the node's stack directory (wherever compose.yaml and .env live), or
set STACK_DIR to point at it from anywhere else.
