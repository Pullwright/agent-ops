# gather-review-feedback.sh — pre-fetch a repo's pull requests that are waiting
# on the agent to address a human's review (requirement 3c).
#
# Given a repo slug, print a JSON array of review-feedback candidates: open,
# non-draft PRs raised by this system whose latest review round asked for
# changes that no commit has answered yet. Each candidate carries the review
# prose verbatim, so the Implementer can act on it without re-querying anything.
#
# Usage: gather-review-feedback.sh <owner/repo> <pr-label> <branch-prefix> [tech-debt-branch-prefix]
#
# Candidate shape:
#   {
#     "source": "review-feedback",
#     "ref": "pr-57-review-4718691960",   // stable, and scoped to THIS round
#     "number": 57,
#     "pr_number": 57,
#     "url": "https://github.com/…/pull/57",
#     "pr_url": "https://github.com/…/pull/57",
#     "title": "fix(blogger-auth): …",
#     "branch": "agent/td26071701-…",
#     "item": "TD26071701",               // the originating item, if inferable
#     "head_sha": "eea6184…",
#     "reviewed_at": "2026-07-17T01:22:54Z",
#     "body": "…every review body and inline comment in this round, verbatim…"
#   }
#
# `pr_number`/`pr_url` duplicate `number`/`url` (the other two finishing
# sources' candidate shapes carry both pairs — see gather-merge-conflicts.sh
# and gather-abandoned-drafts.sh) so that a reader needing "which PR does this
# candidate target?" has one field name that means the same thing in all three
# arrays: the PR-level claim agent-cycle.sh takes alongside the item claim
# (issue #238) reads `pr_number` from here, and `prompts/implementer.md`'s
# review-feedback work order already documented carrying `pr_url` before this
# field existed to satisfy it.
#
# ## Why the Script fetches this and not the Co-Ordinator
#
# Three reasons, and the third is the one that matters:
#   1. Cost, as with gather-findings.sh (requirement 3a): assembling a review
#      round means several calls per PR — reviews, inline comments, general
#      comments, the timeline — and the bodies are long. Paying a model to
#      paginate that is waste.
#   2. The prose must reach the Implementer *verbatim*. A model summarising a
#      review before handing it on is a lossy telephone game about the exact
#      changes a human asked for.
#   3. The candidate rule below has to exist in the fingerprint (requirement 3b)
#      regardless, and requirement 34a says a rule that two components compute
#      gets one definition. This script is it.
#
# ## The candidate rule
#
# A PR is a candidate iff all of:
#   - it is open and not a draft (a draft is the Implementer's own claim marker,
#     not something a human has finished reviewing);
#   - it carries <pr-label> and its head branch starts with <branch-prefix> —
#     i.e. this system raised it. The Landing Gate is explicit that branches
#     outside branch_prefix belong to humans, and an agent force-pushing a
#     colleague's PR because they asked for changes would be a memorable way to
#     learn that;
#   - `reviewDecision` is CHANGES_REQUESTED;
#   - **no review-thread event answers the blocking review.**
#
# The first and third clauses together are why this source structurally cannot
# see the change request PR #512 carried, and a reader should not have to
# re-derive that. On this system's own pull requests a human cannot file a
# formal `REQUEST_CHANGES` review at all — every pipeline write and every human
# comment on them land under the same GitHub account, and GitHub refuses that
# review type from a pull request's own author — so their instrument is a plain
# PR comment, usually paired with converting the pull request back to draft.
# That produces neither a non-draft pull request nor a `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
# decision, so no such pull request is ever a candidate here. Requirement 31c's
# reconciliation gate (`lib/reconciliation-gate.sh`, agent-ops#533) covers that
# case instead, at the Reviewer's hand-off rather than at selection: widening
# this rule would be the wrong place, since the Reviewer can push the fix
# itself.
#
# That last clause is load-bearing, not a refinement. The agent raises PRs as
# the authenticated user, and GitHub forbids approving or dismissing a review on
# your own PR — so the agent *cannot* clear CHANGES_REQUESTED, and the decision
# stays set even after the fix is pushed. Without the clause, every PR the agent
# fixed would remain a candidate forever: selected, re-fixed, re-selected, on the
# hour, until a human happened to look. The failure would be invisible, because
# each cycle would look like a productive one.
#
# ## Why events, not commit timestamps
#
# This used to compare the blocking review's `submitted_at` against the head
# commit's `committedDate`: newer review means our turn, newer commit means the
# human's. That comparison has a forgeable input. A conflict-resolution
# force-push re-stamps every commit's date to push time, and on PR #205 that
# silently satisfied "commit newer than review" — the branch had a fresh commit
# date from a rebase that never touched the review's actual findings, so the
# round read as answered and the PR dropped out of every selection query while
# the human's CHANGES_REQUESTED sat unanswered. The Enabler caught it hours
# later, by hand.
#
# The fix is to derive "answered" from signals GitHub itself timestamps at the
# moment they happen, none of which a rebase can produce:
#   - a **marked reply from the Implementer** — a review or a general PR
#     comment carrying `lib/pipeline-marker.sh`'s invisible marker with
#     `actor=implementer`, i.e. this system's own answer to the round
#     (`prompts/implementer.md`'s "Answer the review before you finish").
#     `gh pr comment` and `gh pr review --comment` file the same words under
#     different collections, so both are checked, the same way
#     gather-abandoned-drafts.sh already does for its own staleness clock.
#     The marker also carries `actor=script`, `actor=enabler`, `actor=reviewer`
#     or `actor=refiner` for other kinds of pipeline write, and two of those
#     are by definition not answers: `actor=script` records a stage giving up,
#     and `actor=enabler` a stall being diagnosed. On PR #269 exactly those two
#     comments closed the round under the old "any marked reply" rule and the
#     work sat stranded until a human was escalated (agent-ops#278). A legacy
#     marked comment with no `actor=` field does not answer the round either,
#     for the same reason.
#   - a **review-requested event** — the timeline record of
#     `confirm_review_requested` (`lib/handoff.sh`) asking the blocking
#     reviewer to look again, which GitHub stamps at request time regardless of
#     what any commit says.
# A round is answered iff either kind of event happened after the blocking
# review was submitted. Nothing about a force-push can produce either: it
# moves no comment, leaves no review body, and asks no one to re-review.
#
# The extraction and the answered/unanswered decision are
# `lib/handoff.sh`'s `handoff_answer_events` / `handoff_round_answered`
# (requirement 34a): this script passes all three signals — reviews, PR
# comments and the timeline's `review_requested` events — while
# scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh (requirement 38c) calls the same
# functions with the timeline omitted, so its own re-request cannot read
# back next cycle as an answer to itself (tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26080804.md).
#
# ## Gather every review in the round, not just the blocking one
#
# The substance and the formal signal routinely live in different reviews by
# different accounts, because GitHub will not let the PR's author request
# changes on it. On this project the agent raises the PR as `warwickallen`, that
# account can therefore only leave a COMMENTED review, and the human's second
# account posts the CHANGES_REQUESTED — whose body, in the wild, reads in full:
# "Refer to https://github.com/…#pullrequestreview-4718691960". Gathering only
# the blocking review would hand the Implementer the word "Refer to" and nothing
# to act on. So the body below is every review and inline comment submitted
# since the round began, whoever wrote it.
#
# ## Why the ref is scoped to the review round
#
# `pr-<n>-review-<review-id>`, not `pr-<n>`. An item that gets recorded blocked
# (requirement 34) stays blocked until something clears it — so a bare `pr-57`
# that the Implementer once failed on would still be blocked when the human
# posted fresh guidance, and their new review would land on a dead item. Scoping
# the ref to the review id means each new round is a new item that no old block
# covers. Same reasoning as the review-dated `review-<date>-R-NN` refs: these
# expire by irrelevance, which is the only expiry an unattended system performs.
#
# ## Every `gh api --paginate` read streams; none aggregates inside `--jq`
#
# `--paginate` re-runs the `--jq` filter once per page and prints each page's
# result as its own JSON document — it does not concatenate pages before
# filtering. A filter that builds an aggregate itself (`[.[] | …]`) is
# therefore computed *per page* and disagrees with itself past the endpoint's
# default page size (thirty, for every endpoint this script reads): two or
# more array literals land in the variable instead of one, `jq -e 'type ==
# "array"'` cannot catch it (jq evaluates the filter once per input document
# and exits on the last one's truth, so the guard only establishes "every
# document is an array", never "this is one array"), and `--argjson`
# downstream fails to parse the multi-document value.
#
# So every read below — reviews, issue comments, the timeline, inline PR
# comments — has its `--jq` filter emit one object per matching item, with no
# enclosing `[...]`, and the four resulting streams are slurped into a single
# array afterwards with `jq -s -c '.'`. This is the rule the whole script
# follows, not a per-call detail: the same pattern `_handoff_blocking_
# reviewers` (lib/handoff.sh) and `_sweep_round_answered`
# (scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh) already use, for the same reason.
#
# Fails safe: always prints a valid JSON array and exits 0. A repo where nothing
# is under review contributes `[]`; an API that will not answer contributes `[]`
# too, and the cycle simply does not see this source (see gather-source-state.sh
# for why the *fingerprint* must not be so relaxed).
#
# Environment: REVIEW_FEEDBACK_GH overrides `gh` (tests stub it).
