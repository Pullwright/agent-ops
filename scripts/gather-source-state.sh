# gather-source-state.sh — sample the cheap change-detection signals for one
# repo's work sources (docs/spec/implementation/README.md,
# requirement 3b).
#
# Given a repo slug and its default branch, print one JSON object digesting
# everything the Co-Ordinator's verdict depends on but does *not* receive in
# its runtime input — the things it would go and read for itself. The Script
# hashes this (with the inputs it does pass) into the no-op fingerprint that
# decides whether engaging the Co-Ordinator at all could possibly produce a
# different answer than last time.
#
# Usage: gather-source-state.sh <owner/repo> <default-branch>
#
# Output shape:
#   {
#     "slug": "Poetic-Poems/poetic",
#     "ok": true,
#     "head_sha": "…",                                       // tech-debt, plan, review, code
#     "issues":    [{"n":7,"u":"…","l":["bug"],"a":"","p":"High"}],  // issues source
#     "workflows": [{"w":123,"c":"failure"}],                // failed-runs source
#     "open_prs":  [{"n":9,"u":"…","h":"agent/x","d":true}]  // claim signals
#   }
#
# ## `ok` is the whole safety argument
#
# Each signal is fetched with `gh api`, which exits non-zero on an HTTP error
# but zero on a legitimately empty result. The distinction matters enormously
# here, and in a way it does not for gather-findings.sh:
#
#   - gather-findings.sh may degrade to `[]`, because its output is *given to
#     the Co-Ordinator*. If the alerts API is down, the Co-Ordinator sees no
#     findings and declines — and a fingerprint saying "no findings" is a
#     faithful record of the input the Co-Ordinator actually got. The skip and
#     the model agree, which is exactly the contract.
#   - This script must not, because its output is a *proxy* for reads the
#     Co-Ordinator performs itself. A failing issues API that degraded to `[]`
#     would produce a stable, wrong "nothing changed" digest while the
#     Co-Ordinator, reading the API directly, would have found live work. Two
#     consecutive failures would then match each other and skip the cycle —
#     and go on skipping for as long as the API stayed down. Silent, green,
#     and indefinitely idle: the exact failure this system is prone to.
#
# So an API error sets `ok: false` and the Script refuses to fingerprint at
# all: no skip, and no fingerprint recorded against a `none-selected`. The cost
# of a false `ok: false` is one Co-Ordinator run — which is what we would have
# paid anyway.
#
# Never exits non-zero: it always prints a valid object, marking `ok: false`
# when it could not sample cleanly. A gatherer that aborted the cycle would
# make cost control a reliability risk, which is a bad trade at any saving.

# api_json_paged FALLBACK PAGE_FILTER JOIN_FILTER API_PATH
# `api_json` for a list endpoint whose *completeness* downstream readers
# depend on. A single `gh api` call returns one page — the newest `per_page`
# entries — and requirement 34i's work-gone sweep reads an issue's or pull
# request's *absence* from the digest as "closed": on a repository with more
# open issues than one page holds, every issue past the first page read as
# closed, and the sweep cleared real blocks out from under real work the
# moment they formed (this is what falsely unblocked #874 on 2026-09-04 and
# handed the fleet-wide phantom-refinement stand-down its trigger; it also
# defeated the hand-flag lever the same day, clearing the blocks 11 seconds
# after they formed). `--paginate` walks every page; PAGE_FILTER runs once
# per page (that is `gh api --jq`'s own `--paginate` behaviour, the same
# per-page streaming every other paginated gatherer in scripts/ already
# leans on) and must yield one JSON array per page; JOIN_FILTER runs over
# the slurped array-of-pages to flatten and order them.
#
# The fail-safe direction is preserved by construction: `gh api --paginate`
# exits non-zero when any page fails, the pipeline's status is the pipe's
# (this script runs under `set -o pipefail`), and the caller flips `ok` —
# so a half-walked listing decides nothing, exactly as a failed single page
# never did. A truncated-but-2xx listing is no longer a representable state.

# Open issues. `updated_at` moves on a comment, a label, a title edit or an

# (requirement 16.4) — so a triage action that makes an issue selectable, or

#
# `p` is the issue's `Priority` band, which requirement 15e *ranks* on: an issue
# re-prioritised from Low to Urgent is a different verdict from the same set of
# issues, so the band has to be in the digest in its own right. Leaving it to
# `updated_at` would be the "covered by something else" trap requirement 3b
# warns about — whether an issue-field edit touches `updated_at` is GitHub's
# choice, not ours, and a ranking signal covered only by someone else's
# timestamp is a signal that can go uncovered without anything looking wrong.
#
# Unset, unreadable, or not one of the four names reads as `Medium`, matching
# the Co-Ordinator's own default exactly. That matters more than it looks: if
# the two disagreed, the digest would be stable while the model's verdict
# changed (or the reverse), which is the one failure this whole file exists to
# prevent. The `Priority` field is `organization_members_only`, so a token that
# cannot see it must land on the same band the Co-Ordinator will.
#
# `repos/<slug>/issues` returns pull requests too; they are dropped here and
# sampled properly below.
#
# Paged to completion (`api_json_paged` above), and so is the open-PR listing

# *completeness* is load-bearing, not just their freshness. The workflow-runs
# window below stays a single page by design — its own comment names that the
# safe direction.
#
# `p`'s parse is deliberately identical to gather-issues.sh's own — same
# field, same four names, same Medium default — and stays that way on
# purpose (requirement 3b). gather-issues.sh additionally emits
# `priority_set` (requirement 39g), a boolean the Refiner's triage candidate
# rule needs to tell "unset" from "explicitly Medium"; it is not added here
# for symmetry's own sake, because nothing downstream of this digest needs
# it: `maybe_run_refiner` (agent-cycle.sh) engages the Refiner from every
# cycle's own exit trap, unconditionally on the no-op fingerprint this file
# feeds, so a candidate set this digest never causes a skipped cycle to miss.

# The conclusion of each workflow's latest *completed* run on the default
# branch. This is the one source whose state can change with no commit at all:
# a scheduled run, or a re-run, can turn `main` red (or green) while every SHA
# stays put. Keyed on the workflow, taking the highest run id, mirroring
# requirement 15's rule that only the *most recent* run of a workflow counts.
#
# The run id is deliberately *not* part of the digest, only the conclusion it
# reached. Requirement 15's candidate is "this workflow's latest run is a
# failure" — a fact about the conclusion. A green workflow running again is a
# new id and the same answer, so digesting the id would report a change that
# cannot affect any verdict.
#
# This is not hypothetical tidiness. `poetic` schedules sync-framework.yml at
# `0 * * * *` — hourly, an external cadence independent of this pipeline's own
# (`schedule.cycle_interval_minutes`, rendered per node into its own cycle
# minutes, never `0`). Digesting run ids made that one workflow bust the
# fingerprint on every cycle whose tick landed after its latest run, which
# quietly reduced the whole short-circuit to a no-op that still paid for a
# Co-Ordinator: the feature would have looked installed, logged nothing
# unusual, and saved nothing. Any repo with a scheduled workflow does this;
# ours does.
#
# Incomplete runs are dropped rather than digested as an empty conclusion. A
# run in flight is not yet a failure (so it is not yet a candidate), and
# sampling one mid-flight would otherwise register two changes per run — one
# when it starts, one when it lands — for a workflow that ends up exactly where
# it began.
