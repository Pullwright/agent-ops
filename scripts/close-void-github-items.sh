# scripts/close-void-github-items.sh — act on a corroborated void by closing
# the GitHub object it names, instead of leaving a tombstone only this
# pipeline's own log can see (requirement 34k).
#
# A void (requirement 34c) already stops the item being selected again — but
# nothing before this closed the *object* the void is about, so an obsolete
# draft pull request or a superseded issue stayed open, visible to every
# human and every other tool that reads GitHub rather than this pipeline's
# log, and kept being re-derived void by cycle after cycle (issue #240:
# poetic-fiddle #190/#214 were re-derived void on 7+ separate cycles, never
# closed). This closes it, with the void's own reason and evidence as the
# comment, the moment the void exists — and never touches it again
# (`void-object-closed`, logged by the caller from this script's output, is
# how a later cycle knows not to re-check an item this already settled, even
# if a human reopens the object directly rather than through the
# `unvoid_label` this pipeline actually watches). When a pull request being
# closed this way already carries the human-applied `obsolete` label — the
# corroboration lib/void-guard.sh's `void_finishing_pr_reason` accepts in
# place of an empty diff for the `-abandoned-`/`-review-` shapes
# (TD-PPagop-26081308) — the close comment names it, re-checked live here
# rather than trusted from the void's own claim, so the close is auditable
# from the comment alone.
#
# Only the two id shapes that name a GitHub object at all (`lib/work-gone.sh`'s
# own definitions, reused rather than re-derived — requirement 34a):
#   a bare issue number       closes the issue, iff GitHub still reports it open
#   `pr-<n>-…`                closes the pull request, iff still open —
#                             *except* `pr-<n>-conflict-<head-sha>` and
#                             `pr-<n>-dequeued-<head-sha>`: those shapes say
#                             the *conflict* (or the dequeue) is gone, not the
#                             pull request, which stays a live PR of
#                             ours (requirement 34k). Closing it on this void
#                             would discard live work — it did, for real, to
#                             pull request #264 — so these two shapes are left
#                             alone exactly like a non-GitHub-object void
#                             (TD-PPagop-26080901, extended to `dequeued` by
#                             TD-PPagop-26081409). Its sibling shape,
#                             `pr-<n>-superseded-<head-sha>` (a Dependabot bump
#                             a newer open bump has made moot, requirement 3s),
#                             makes the opposite claim — the pull request
#                             itself is moot, not merely its conflict — so it
#                             is *not* excluded: it closes through the ordinary
#                             `pr-<n>-…` branch above like any other pull
#                             request void (TD-PPagop-26081304). No logic in
#                             this file distinguishes these shapes; the
#                             exclusion below matches `-conflict-` and
#                             `-dequeued-` alone.
# Every other void shape (a tech-debt register id, a review ref, a plan task
# id) names something that is not a GitHub object to close and is left alone
# here entirely.
#
# One further writer is eligible without passing that guard:
# `stage: "decision"`, the `item-void` requirement 36f's `corroborate-void`
# act writes (`run_pending_decision_acts`, lib/decision-veto.sh). Its
# corroboration is the one an open draft that still changes files can never
# get from an API call — a decision taken under the delegate mandate, filed
# as a closed `pw::decision` issue, and left un-reopened for the whole of
# `decision_veto_window_hours`. That is the same judgement the human-applied
# `obsolete` label carries, made by the pipeline under a mandate the owner
# switched on, with the lever in front of the act rather than behind it.
#
# And only a void whose writer's verdict passes requirement 34d's
# corroboration guard — every stage, now that issue #243 made
# `void_guard_reason` the one path all three (`coordinator`, `enabler`,
# `implementer`) write `item-void` through. Before #243 the Implementer's and
# the Enabler's voids were the model's own unexamined claim — issue #240
# scoped this action to a void that "survives corroboration (WI-7)", and
# until #243 corroborated those two writers, acting on them would have let an
# unexamined "already done" close a live issue. The gate was on corroboration,
# not on the stage name, so once every writer earned it the gate simply opened
# to all three — a stage this script has never heard of (a future writer that
# does not go through the guard) still stops here, unrecognised.
#
# Usage: close-void-github-items.sh <owner/repo> <node-name> <cycle-id>
# Stdin: a JSON array of this repo's void candidates, each
#   {"item": "198", "detail": "…", "evidence": "…", "stage": "coordinator"}
# (the shape `void_items` in lib/cycle-state.sh already produces, filtered by
# the caller to this repo and to items requirement 34k's exclusion set —
# `void_object_closed_items` — has not already processed).
#
# Output: one JSON object per action on stdout —
#   {"action":"closed","item":"198","kind":"issue","closed_by":"sweep"}
#   {"action":"closed","item":"pr-205-abandoned-…","kind":"pull-request","number":205,"closed_by":"already"}
#   {"action":"warning","item":"198","detail":…}
#   {"action":"deferred","remaining":N}
# `closed_by: "already"` means the object was found already closed (by a
# human, or some other route) — still reported, so the caller logs
# `void-object-closed` and this item is never checked again. The caller logs
# every action; this script logs nothing itself. Exit 0 unless the arguments
# are unusable.
#
# Environment: SWEEP_GH overrides `gh` (tests stub it).
