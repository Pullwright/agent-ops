# Extracts `##` and `###` headings from markdown files (ignoring the top-level
# `# ` title, code blocks, and anything inside fenced code), generates a nested
# markdown bullet list with links using GitHub's auto-generated anchor slugging,
# and writes/checks the list between `<!-- toc:start -->` / `<!-- toc:end -->`
# marker pairs placed immediately after each document's title and any lead-in
# paragraph, before the first `##` heading.
#
# With no arguments, regenerate the ToC in both files. `--check` verifies that
# both files' regions are current (exit non-zero if stale), mirroring
# render-config-table.sh's contract.
