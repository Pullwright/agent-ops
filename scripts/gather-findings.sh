# gather-findings.sh — pre-fetch a repo's open security and code-quality
# findings for the Co-Ordinator (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md, requirement 3a).
#
# Given a GitHub repo slug (owner/repo), pull the repo's open Dependabot
# alerts and open code-scanning alerts via `gh api`, normalise each into a
# compact finding, and print the lot as a single JSON array on stdout, most
# security-relevant and most severe first.
#
# This runs in the Script, not in a model, precisely so the cheap Co-Ordinator
# session never spends tokens paginating and digesting those verbose APIs.
#
# Fails safe: a disabled feature (Dependabot or code scanning turned off, which
# GitHub answers with 404, or 403 with a message naming the feature rather
# than a rate limit) contributes no findings and the script still prints valid
# JSON and exits 0 — a missing feature must never abort a cycle. A real
# failure (a timeout, a rate limit, an outage) is different: it must not
# render exactly like "nothing to report" (TD-PPagop-26080201), so it is
# distinguished from an absent feature by the error body's own `.status`,
# and the script exits 1 rather than swallowing it. 403 alone cannot carry that
# distinction on its own, unlike 404: GitHub uses it both for "this feature is
# turned off here" and for "you have been rate-limited", so a 403 is only
# legitimate when its own message does not say rate limit.
#
# Usage: gather-findings.sh <owner/repo>
