# check-node-compose.sh — is this node's compose.yaml, and the containers it
# created, still what the repository would deploy?
#
# A node holds its own copy of deploy/docker/compose.yaml, and an image roll
# cannot update it: labels, service environment and mounts arrive only via a
# human running `docker compose up -d` on that host (issue #131). The
# in-container check (lib/compose-drift.sh) answers for the *file* from
# inside and publishes its verdict in the node's heartbeat; what it cannot
# see is whether the running containers were actually created from that file
# — a file synced without `up -d` reads in-sync while the containers still
# carry the old config — or watchtower's own environment, the one container
# nothing ever rolls. Both need the Docker socket. This script answers from
# the host, where the socket lives.
#
# Run it on the node's host, from the stack directory (wherever compose.yaml
# and .env live — see deploy/docker/README.md), or point STACK_DIR at one; a
# host running two stacks runs it once per directory. Read-only throughout —
# `docker compose exec/ps`, `docker inspect/logs` and a diff — so it is safe
# to allow-list wholesale, like watch-node.sh.
#
# The checks, each a property that has actually been lost in the field:
#   env perms  .env is 0600, and no .env.bak*/*.env.old backup sits beside it
#              (#696) — .env carries this node's live tokens in plaintext, and
#              a world- or group-readable copy, or a stale dated backup, hands
#              them to any other account on the host. Host filesystem only, no
#              Docker socket needed; flagging only, never chmod or delete.
#   file       the stack's compose.yaml against the copy inside the running
#              image (comments and blank lines aside) — has the merged change
#              reached this host's file at all?
#   mount      the scheduler carries /host/compose.yaml, so the in-container
#              check is armed and the heartbeat verdict means something
#   labels     every running container on the agent-ops image carries the
#              watchtower pre-update hook label — the property whose silent
#              loss cost the cycles that led to #131
#   watchtower lifecycle hooks are enabled in its *actual* environment (not
#              the file's), and schedule/interval are not both set
#   reconciler the reconciler's own last verdict is not `refused` — every

#              one is current, and a refusal only bites at the next one
#
# The container checks are the ground truth and the file check is the early
# warning: a clean file with stale containers fails the label/env checks, a
# stale file fails the diff. What this script does not attempt is a full

usage: check-node-compose.sh

Verify, from a node's host, that its compose.yaml and the containers created
from it have not fallen behind the repository: the file against the running
image's own copy, the pre-update hook label on every agent-ops container,
watchtower's actual environment, and the reconciler's last verdict.

Run from the node's stack directory (wherever compose.yaml and .env live), or
set STACK_DIR to point at it. A host running two stacks: once per directory.

Exit 0 all checks passed, 1 at least one failed, 2 could not check.
