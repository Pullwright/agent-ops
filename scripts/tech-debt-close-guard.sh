# scripts/tech-debt-close-guard.sh — advisory check that a closed
# `pw::type:tech-debt` issue carries some evidence of its resolution (issue
# #877; D15 as revised, #869/#875/#879's "close-guard", the resolution-
# discipline mitigation for a tech-debt issue closed without a pull request).
#
# Since D15's revision, tech debt is a GitHub issue and its permanent record
# is the resolving pull request's `td-record` body block (requirement 25),
# written the moment the issue closes with a real closing keyword. That path
# is enforced deterministically by `.github/workflows/closing-keyword.yml`.
# This is the other path: an issue closed some other way — by hand, or
# `not_planned` — has no pull request to carry a record, so the only trace
# left is whatever the closer wrote at the time. This posts one comment
# naming what is missing when nothing was; it never reopens the issue,
# never relabels it, and never blocks anything — the check that follows a
# closed issue, not one that gates a merge.
#
# Two kinds of evidence, by `state_reason`:
#   - `completed` (or unset — GitHub's own default, and any reason this script
#     does not know): a closing pull request or commit the issue's own timeline
#     names (its most recent `ClosedEvent.closer`), or a comment already on the
#     issue.
#   - `not_planned`, `duplicate`: a comment already on the issue, stating why.
#     Neither close resolves anything, so neither can have a closing pull
#     request to point at.
# Either requirement is satisfied by *any* comment already present — this
# does not read a comment's content, the same simplification
# `check-closing-keyword.sh` makes about a closing keyword's own wording.
# The guard's own past comments on the same issue never count as that
# comment: without excluding them, the first guarded close would leave a
# comment that silently satisfied every later close of the same issue.
#
# Idempotent per close: the comment it posts carries
# `<!-- agent-ops:td-close-guard closed_at=<issue's own closed_at> -->`, and a
# comment with that exact marker already present skips posting a second one —
# a workflow re-run must not double-comment on the same close. A later close
# of the same issue carries a different `closed_at` and is judged fresh.
#
# Usage:
#   tech-debt-close-guard.sh <repo-slug> <issue-number> <state-reason> <labels-csv> <closed-at>
#
# <state-reason>: GitHub's own `state_reason` — "completed", "not_planned",
#   "duplicate", or empty (treated as "completed", GitHub's own default when a
#   closer states none). Any other value GitHub may add later follows the
#   "completed" rule and is named verbatim in the comment, never re-reported
#   as a completed close.
# <labels-csv>: the issue's label names, comma-separated; a labels list not
#   carrying `pw::type:tech-debt` is not this guard's concern and exits 0
#   without calling GitHub at all.
# <closed-at>: the issue's own `closed_at`, ISO-8601 — used only for the
#   idempotency marker above.
#
# GH_TOKEN (or gh's own login) needs `issues:write` on <repo-slug>. `GH`
# overrides the `gh` binary, for tests.
#
# Prints one JSON object on success and always exits 0 — a guard comment this
# script fails to post is not a broken close, the same "advisory, never
# fails its caller" contract every housekeeping script in this directory
# keeps, for the same reason:
#   {"issue": N, "action": "none", "reason": "<why nothing was needed>"}
#   {"issue": N, "action": "commented", "reason": "<what was missing>"}
#   {"issue": N, "action": "skipped", "reason": "guard already commented on this close"}
#   {"issue": N, "action": "warning", "reason": "<what was missing> (comment post failed)"}
#   {"issue": N, "action": "warning", "reason": "cannot verify: comments fetch failed"}
# Exit 2 (usage) on missing/malformed arguments only.

# #1116, where the same pairing had been silently disarming `lib/claim.sh`'s
# branch-claim listing. Here it would have cost both of requirement 25b's
# guarantees at once: a close carrying a perfectly good resolution comment
# would draw a guard comment anyway, and the idempotency check below, reading
# the same empty list, would post a second one on every workflow re-run.
#
# The fetch's own exit status is captured before piping into `jq`, and never

# `[]` fallback on empty stdout cannot tell apart from a genuinely empty
# list. On a failed fetch this exits with `warning` and posts nothing — "cannot
# verify" is not "unguarded" — rather than risking a spurious advisory comment,
# or, on a re-run during the same outage, a second one for the same close.
