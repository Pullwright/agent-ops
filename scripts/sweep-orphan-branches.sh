# scripts/sweep-orphan-branches.sh — find claim branches whose work became
# invisible, and put it back in front of the pipeline (requirement 17b).
#
# The orphan this hunts: an Implementer pushes commits to its claim branch and
# dies before the draft pull request exists. Nothing recovers it —
# `gather-abandoned-drafts.sh` lists PRs, not branches — and nothing can even
# reach it again: the claim gc keeps a moved ref on purpose (pushed work is
# never deleted), every later `claim branch` 422s against it, and the
# Co-Ordinator's own exclusion reads the live ref as "claimed, skip". The work
# is unreachable, the item is permanently unselectable, and no event ever said
# so. The near-miss sibling is the ref with *no* work on it whose registry
# entry was lost (a best-effort write that never landed), wedging its item the
# same way with nothing to recover at all.
#
# For one repository, this sweeps every `<branch_prefix>*` and `td-record/*`
# ref. `techdebt_file_debt` (`lib/tech-debt-file.sh`) no longer mints a
# `td-record/<id>` branch — agent-ops#874 moved its filing to a
# `pw::type:tech-debt`-labelled issue — but this walk still has to recognise
# and retire any branch a filing from before that move left behind
# (agent-ops#1219) — and, for each one that is provably an orphan — **no
# open PR** uses it, **no registry entry** stands for it, and its tip commit
# is **older than `abandoned_draft_after_hours`** (the same judgement that
# makes a draft abandoned) — does the one thing that makes the state
# self-healing:
#
#   commits ahead, never merged,
#   no rival branch landed the
#   same work                             open a DRAFT pull request from the
#                                         ref, labelled `pr_label`, so the
#                                         existing abandoned-drafts machinery
#                                         recovers the work exactly as it
#                                         recovers any other stalled draft
#   nothing ahead, or ahead but already
#   merged into the default branch        delete the ref: either it was only
#                                         ever the claim, or every repo here
#                                         squash-merges, so a landed branch's
#                                         commits never leave `ahead_by`
#                                         positive and the ref is just a
#                                         leftover the claim gc didn't clean up
#   ahead, never merged, but a rival
#   branch sharing the same item ref
#   merged after this branch's first
#   commit                                delete the ref: this branch lost a
#                                         race and its work already landed
#                                         under a different head, so a
#                                         recovery draft would resurrect
#                                         superseded — sometimes regressed —
#                                         code (issue #500)

#   pull request was closed without
#   merging                               delete the ref: a human declined
#                                         that filing, so a recovery draft
#                                         would hand back exactly the record
#                                         they declined — never recovered,

#                                         alone; then, once the delete lands,

The pipeline pushed commits to \`$branch\` but its cycle died before a pull
request existed, leaving the work invisible: nothing recovers a branch with no
PR, and the live claim ref blocks every later attempt at the same item
(IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC requirement 17b).

This draft makes the work visible to the abandoned-drafts source again. Its
Implementer should read \`gh pr diff\` and the commit messages here, continue
from what already exists rather than starting the item over, and open the
result for review as usual.
