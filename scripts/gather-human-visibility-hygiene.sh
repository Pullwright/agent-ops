# gather-human-visibility-hygiene.sh — pre-fetch a repo's still-live
# human-visibility violations that `scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh`
# (requirement 38c) could not self-heal, so a `gh` read or the review-request
# POST failing there stops being only a `warning` log line nobody re-reads
# (requirement 38e; tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26080801.md).
#
# Given a repo slug and this repo's slice of `human_visibility_violations`
# (lib/human-visibility-hygiene.sh, read from the log union), print a JSON
# array holding at most one candidate: the violations that are still true
# right now, re-verified live rather than trusted from the log alone.
#
# Usage: gather-human-visibility-hygiene.sh <owner/repo> [pr-label]
# Stdin: violations-json — an array of
#   {"repo": "owner/repo", "pr_url": "…" | "", "detail": "…", "ts": "…"}
# — `pr_url` is "" for a repo-level (listing) violation. Entries for a
# different repo are ignored, so a caller may hand this the whole fleet-wide
# array without filtering first. Unreadable or non-array stdin (or none) is
# treated as `[]`, delivered on stdin — never argv — because it is unbounded
# past this call and a shell script's own CLI invocation is subject to
# `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` exactly as `jq --argjson` is (requirement 4g;
# tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26081502.md).
#
# Candidate shape — its own source (issue #284's decision 2): a violation
# here means finished work is
# invisible to the human whose merge everything waits on, the same
# "finishing beats starting" class `review-feedback`, `merge-conflicts` and
# `abandoned-drafts` are:
#   {
#     "source": "human-visibility",
#     "ref": "human-visibility-1a2b3c4d5e6f",  // scoped to THIS set of violations
#     "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pulls",
#     "problems": ["HUMAN VISIBILITY  https://github.com/…/pull/9: could not request review from foo"],
#     "body": "…one paragraph per violation, verbatim detail included…"
#   }
#
# ## Why re-verified live, not trusted from the log alone
#
# The reduction this script's input already went through (`_latest_unresolved`-
# style: latest event per identity wins) clears a per-pull-request violation the
# moment the sweep next succeeds for that same pull request — but a repo-level
# listing failure has no such per-PR success to clear it: a listing that
# succeeds with nothing to act on logs nothing at all, so a one-off blip would
# read as permanently broken. And a per-pull-request violation goes stale a
# different way — the pull request merges or closes, and the sweep never visits
# it again to log anything at all, one way or the other.
#
# So every violation handed in is re-checked against GitHub's live state before
# it becomes a candidate, read-only throughout (issue #284's decision 1: never
# `confirm_review_requested` or `ensure_human_reviewer`, which POST) — a
# repo-level listing failure only survives if the listing still fails right
# now; a pull-request violation only survives if that pull request is still
# open and not a draft, *and* its own warning class's own live signal still
# says the violation holds (below). An answer this script cannot get — `gh`
# itself unreachable for the re-check — is not read as "resolved": the
# violation is kept, on the same reasoning `sweep-human-visibility.sh` itself
# uses (an unread state is never guessed at as clean). Only a *definite* "no
# longer true" answer drops a violation.
#
# ## Six warning classes, told apart
#
# `sweep-human-visibility.sh` logs six different per-pull-request warnings —
# "could not request review from …" (the review-request POST itself failed),
# "could not read the pull request's reviews …" (`_handoff_pr_approved`'s own
# read failing, inside the idle-nudge check alone), "could not read the pull
# request's state …" (the sweep's own broader `gh pr view` read failing, the
# one that gates every downstream check it makes for that pull request),
# "could not post the idle nudge comment" (the nudge comment POST itself
# failed), "no legal review-request candidate" (no POST was even attempted —
# `ensure_human_reviewer`'s `skip\tno-candidate`, tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26081001.md),
# and "could not post the merge-queue-dequeued notice" (the dequeue-notice
# comment POST itself failed, requirement 38f) — and they clear on six
# different live facts. A single shared check would get more than one of them wrong: every
# pull request a nudge warning is logged against is, by the nudge's own gate,
# already `APPROVED` — so a check that only asks "has a human reviewed this"
# would read every nudge-class warning as resolved the moment it is created,
# silently dropping it before anyone ever saw the nudge that failed to post.
# So each class re-verifies its own claim, all but one from the single `gh pr
# view` read `_pr_violation_survives` opens with below:
#
#   could_not_request      — a read-only "is a human review currently
#                             requested (or already given)" check: `gh pr
#                             view --json reviewRequests,reviews`.
#                             A `reviewRequests` entry counts only once it
#                             clears the same *bot* filter `ensure_human_
#                             reviewer`'s own pending read applies — a
#                             bot-typed account or a `[bot]`-suffixed login is
#                             never proof a human was asked
#                             (tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26081403.md) — and a
#                             requested team counts, the same as it does
#                             there; a filtered-nonempty `reviewRequests`
#                             means a request is live right now. Unlike
#                             `ensure_human_reviewer`'s REST read, whose
#                             `requested_reviewers[]` genuinely carries
#                             `"type": "Bot"` and `[bot]`-suffixed logins,
#                             `gh pr view`'s GraphQL-backed exporter
#                             (cli/cli `api/export_pr.go`) emits only
#                             `__typename`-keyed `User`/`Team` entries and
#                             *drops* Bot reviewers from the array entirely
#                             — so a Copilot-only request already arrives
#                             here as `[]` and survives on emptiness alone.
#                             The filter is belt-and-braces for the day that
#                             exporter changes, keyed on `__typename` (what
#                             this reader would actually see) with `type`
#                             retained against a REST-shaped payload. A
#                             non-bot review with state `APPROVED` or
#                             `CHANGES_REQUESTED` means a review already
#                             happened, which only a request already granted
#                             could have produced — either is the violation
#                             resolving itself. Read from the reviews list,
#                             never `reviewDecision` (agent-ops#391,
#                             TD-PPagop-26081505): that field is computed
#                             against the base branch's *required* approving
#                             review count, and on this repository's own
#                             ruleset, which sets that count to `0`, it can
#                             never become `APPROVED` however many humans
#                             approve — the same fact `ensure_human_reviewer`
#                             (`lib/handoff.sh`) already reasons from the
#                             reviews list rather than that field, read here
#                             rather than acted on.
#   could_not_read_reviews — no follow-up *action* outcome to inspect, unlike
#                             the other five classes: the read failing was the
#                             whole violation. The read that failed —
#                             `_handoff_pr_approved`, via `_handoff_pr_query`
#                             (`lib/handoff.sh`) — is, since agent-ops#1085,
#                             the same GraphQL surface the `gh pr view` call
#                             at the top of `_pr_violation_survives` already
#                             opens with, and that call's own `--json` fields
#                             already include `reviews` — the exact data
#                             `_handoff_pr_approved` itself reads. So a
#                             successful `gh pr view` above already *is* the
#                             answer: reaching this class at all means the
#                             read that failed now works, and this class
#                             drops on that alone rather than repeating the
#                             read a second time. Before agent-ops#1085 that
#                             read was a REST `gh api …/reviews --paginate`
#                             call — a different API surface, with its own
#                             rate limit and its own breakable code path, so a
#                             readable `$json` here proved nothing about it,
#                             and this class re-ran `_handoff_pr_approved`
#                             itself to find out.
#   could_not_post_nudge   — did the nudge comment land after all: the
#                             paginated `gh api …/issues/<n>/comments
#                             --paginate` read, searched for a comment
#                             carrying both the exact `<!-- agent-ops:human-
#                             nudge -->` HTML-comment form and `lib/
#                             pipeline-marker.sh`'s own
#                             `PIPELINE_COMMENT_MARKER_PREFIX` stamp — the
#                             same conjunction `sweep-human-visibility.sh`
#                             itself checks for idempotency (agent-ops#390,
#                             #428). Neither alone is safe: the HTML form
#                             alone still matches a comment merely quoting or
#                             discussing the marker (a Reviewer summarising a
#                             change to this very check, say), and the prefix
#                             alone is stamped on every pipeline comment,
#                             nudge or not. The paginated read, rather than
#                             `gh pr view --json comments`, is what keeps this
#                             search from missing a marker posted past that
#                             GraphQL field's unpaginated ~100-comment ceiling
#                             (agent-ops#1858).
#   dequeue_notice          — did the dequeue notice land after all: the same
#                             paginated comments read, searched for the
#                             `<!-- agent-ops:merge-queue-dequeued:` marker
#                             `sweep-human-visibility.sh` itself posts and
#                             checks for idempotency (TD-PPagop-26081504) —
#                             the same shape as `could_not_post_nudge` above,
#                             one comment-marker read per family.
#   no_candidate            — does a candidate exist now: `gh pr view --json
#                             author,reviews,reviewRequests`, generalising
#                             `ensure_human_reviewer`'s own candidate rule
#                             read-only — a non-author, non-bot reviewer
#                             having since reviewed the pull request, a
#                             review request already pending (most often
#                             CODEOWNERS' own auto-request, live before
#                             anyone has reviewed — the `known`-reviewer
#                             check alone cannot see it; the same bot filter
#                             and team-counting as `could_not_request` above
#                             applies here too), or `enabler_assignee`
#                             (carried in the warning's own detail text, at
#                             the value it held when the sweep warned) no
#                             longer naming the author, is the violation
#                             resolving itself: the sweep's own next pass
#                             would report `already` or `requested`, never
#                             `no-candidate` again, before this gatherer runs
#                             again.
#   could_not_read_state    — "could not read the pull request's state —
#                             skipping its review-state checks", the read
#                             that gates every downstream check the sweep
#                             makes for a pull request (`sweep-human-
#                             visibility.sh`'s own broad `gh pr view --json
#                             reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,
#                             statusCheckRollup,reviews` call). Like
#                             `could_not_read_reviews`, the read failing was
#                             the whole violation, and the narrower `gh pr
#                             view --json state,isDraft,reviewRequests,
#                             author,reviews` this function already
#                             opened with above proves nothing about it —
#                             `statusCheckRollup` alone is not in that field
#                             list, and a broader query is its own
#                             opportunity to fail even when a narrower one
#                             does not. So this class re-runs the sweep's own
#                             call verbatim and drops the violation only once
#                             that call succeeds again.
#   (anything else)         — a warning this script does not recognise (a
#                             future warning shape) has no live signal of its
#                             own to check, so it is kept for as long as the
#                             pull request stays open and not a draft — the
#                             same fail-safe default an unreadable re-check
#                             gets.
#
# A pull request that has since merged, closed, or gone back to draft drops
# every class's violation regardless — none of the above can matter to a
# human on a pull request nobody is being asked to look at any more.
#
# ## The ref
#
# `human-visibility-<12 hex>`, a digest of the surviving violations' own
# identities and details (sorted, so entry order never matters) — not a bare
# `human-visibility`, for "expiry by irrelevance": a block recorded against one set of violations must not
# swallow a later, disjoint set, while re-detecting the *same* set keeps the
# same ref and stays correctly blocked.
#
# Fails safe: always prints a valid JSON array and exits 0. No violations
# handed in, or none surviving the live re-check, is `[]` — the ordinary
# answer almost every cycle gets.
