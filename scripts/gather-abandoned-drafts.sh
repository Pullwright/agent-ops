# gather-abandoned-drafts.sh — pre-fetch a repo's draft pull requests this system
# raised and then abandoned (requirement 3e).
#
# Given a repo slug, print a JSON array of abandoned-draft candidates: open,
# *draft* PRs this system raised whose last **real** activity was at least
# <stale-hours> ago. Each is a nearly-finished piece of work an Implementer stage
# started, claimed with a draft PR, and never carried to `ready` — because the
# stage timed out, hit a usage limit, or died. Finishing one costs less than
# starting fresh and frees the back-pressure slot the stalled PR occupies.
#
# Usage: gather-abandoned-drafts.sh <owner/repo> <pr-label> <branch-prefix> [stale-hours] [tech-debt-branch-prefix]
#
# Candidate shape:
#   {
#     "source": "abandoned-drafts",
#     "ref": "pr-80-abandoned-1a2b3c4d5e6f", // stable, and scoped to THIS head
#     "number": 80,
#     "pr_number": 80,
#     "url": "https://github.com/…/pull/80",
#     "pr_url": "https://github.com/…/pull/80",
#     "title": "fix(cache): …",
#     "branch": "agent/td26072001-…",
#     "item": "TD26072001",                  // the originating item, if inferable
#     "head_sha": "1a2b3c4d5e6f…",
#     "updated_at": "2026-07-24T03:00:00Z",  // last REAL activity, not GitHub's updatedAt
#     "body": "…the draft PR's own description, the original plan, verbatim…"
#   }
#
# ## Why the Script fetches this and not the Co-Ordinator
#
# Same three reasons as gather-review-feedback.sh (requirement 3c), and the third
# is again the one that matters:
#   1. Cost, as with gather-findings.sh (requirement 3a): the staleness test is a
#      timestamp comparison against the clock, not something worth a model turn.
#   2. The draft PR's own body is the original plan and must reach the Implementer
#      verbatim, not summarised.
#   3. The candidate rule below has to exist in the fingerprint (requirement 3b)
#      regardless, and requirement 34a says a rule two components compute gets one
#      definition. This script is it — and this source is the reason draft
#      staleness is fingerprinted at all (see the note on the clock below).
#
# ## The candidate rule
#
# A PR is a candidate iff all of:
#   - it is open and **is** a draft. A draft is precisely the Implementer's own
#     claim marker (requirement 23): a draft that has been sitting untouched is a
#     claim whose owner never came back. A *ready* PR is finished work waiting on
#     the human and is not ours to touch (that is review-feedback's job).
#   - it carries <pr-label> and its head branch starts with <branch-prefix> —
#     i.e. this system raised it. The Human
#     Gate reserves every other branch for humans; an abandoned draft on a human's
#     branch is the human's to finish, not ours to force-push.
#   - its last **real** activity was at least <stale-hours> ago (TD26072605). A
#     push, a genuine review, or a comment a human (or a peer node acting on a
#     human's behalf) wrote all reset this clock — any of those means somebody is
#     on it. Two things this system itself does must NOT reset it, because when
#     this system touches a PR that is usually evidence the opposite just
#     happened:
#       - a **label edit** — discounted unconditionally. The label set
#         (`complexity:*`, `unvoided`, …) is the pipeline's own bookkeeping
#         surface, never evidence of work in progress; a human who wants a PR
#         looked at sooner has `pr_label` for that.
#       - a **comment this system posted itself** — the Enabler's write, a
#         stage-failure comment, a Reviewer's flag left before handoff. Each is
#         stamped with the invisible marker `lib/pipeline-marker.sh` defines
#         (`PIPELINE_COMMENT_MARKER_PREFIX`), and this script discounts any
#         comment carrying it. A human's comment carries no marker and always
#         counts. Filtering by author cannot make this distinction — every
#         pipeline write happens under the same GitHub account a human also
#         comments as — so the marker, not the author, is the test.
#         The body is what is tested, not the collection it landed in:
#         `gh pr comment` files a write under `comments`, `gh pr review
#         --comment` files the same words under `reviews`, and the Reviewer is
#         told it may use either (`prompts/reviewer.md` step 5), so both are
#         matched against the marker. A human's review — an approval, a
#         change request, an inline note — carries no marker either way.
#     The threshold is `abandoned_draft_after_hours`, comfortably beyond a whole
#     cycle so a draft that is merely being worked never qualifies. "A whole
#     cycle" is 4 cadence firings, not a fixed number of hours (requirement 1d):
#     absent, the threshold is derived from `schedule.cycle_interval_minutes`
#     so it stays 4 firings wide at whatever cadence is configured, rather than
#     needing to move by hand every time a stage timeout or the cadence itself
#     changes the way #203's interim raise (3 h to 4 h) once had to. Where the
#     margin does run out, it costs little: candidacy is not selection, and a
#     draft another node is genuinely working is claimed, so a premature
#     candidate loses the claim race (requirement 17a) rather than duplicating
#     the work.
#
# ## Why the clock is "last real activity", not GitHub's `updatedAt`
#
# `updatedAt` moves for anything at all — a push, a comment, a label or a title
# edit — including the pipeline's own housekeeping. Two measurements on
# poetic#92 showed why that is unsafe to trust wholesale: a label edit deferred
# detection by a full `abandoned_draft_after_hours`, and — the sharper case — the
# Enabler's own comment correctly diagnosing the stall reset the clock in the
# same breath it cleared the block, deferring the very recovery it had just
# enabled. So this script computes its own measure instead of reading
# `updatedAt`: the latest of the head commit's `committedDate` and of every
# **non-marker** review's `submittedAt` and comment's `createdAt`. That handles
# both cases at once — a label edit touches none of the three, and a marker
# write is excluded from the other two — without needing to know who authored
# anything.
#
# A marker-carrying comment resets the clock **not at all**, not partially: the
# Enabler's own verdict already lands as an `unblocked`/`still-blocked` event the
# selection rules read directly (requirement 18), so there is no information a
# partial reset here would add.
#
# ## Why staleness must be sampled here, against the clock
#
# This is the one candidate rule in the system that turns on the passage of time
# rather than on an event. Last-real-activity does not change as the hours pass,
# so a draft crossing the threshold moves *nothing* in gather-source-state.sh's
# open-PR digest — the fingerprint (requirement 3b) would sit unchanged across
# exactly the moment work appears, and the no-op short-circuit would skip it
# until the forced recheck. Computing candidacy here, with `date`, and feeding
# the resulting array into the fingerprint verbatim (as agent-cycle.sh does for
# review_feedback) is what makes the transition visible: the array gains an entry
# the cycle the draft goes stale, and that busts the fingerprint. See
# lib/noop-skip.sh.
#
# `gather-source-state.sh`'s own open-PR digest is deliberately unlike this
# script: it keys on GitHub's raw `updated_at` on purpose, to notice *any* change
# on an open PR as a proxy for reads the Co-Ordinator would otherwise perform
# itself (see that script's header). That digest is not this source's candidate
# rule and must keep reading the raw field.
#
# ## Why the ref is scoped to the head SHA
#
# `pr-<n>-abandoned-<head-sha>`, not `pr-<n>-abandoned`. An item recorded blocked
# (requirement 34) stays blocked until something clears it, so a bare
# `pr-<n>-abandoned` that an Implementer once failed on would still be blocked
# after fresh commits landed on the branch — and the new state, which might be
# perfectly finishable, would never be looked at again. Scoping the ref to the
# head SHA means each distinct abandoned state is its own item that no older block
# covers, while a draft abandoned again at the *same* head keeps the same ref and
# stays correctly blocked. Same reasoning as review-feedback's per-round
# `pr-<n>-review-<id>` refs: an unattended system expires items by irrelevance.
#
# Fails safe: always prints a valid JSON array and exits 0. A repo with no
# abandoned drafts contributes `[]`; an API that will not answer contributes `[]`
# too (the source simply does not fire this cycle) — but note gather-source-state.sh
# must NOT be so relaxed about the same PRs, for the reason it documents. A PR
# whose real activity cannot be computed (its head commit's date could not be
# read — should never happen, but a malformed API response is not licence to
# guess) is excluded rather than treated as maximally stale: the dangerous
# direction here is stealing live work, not leaving a genuinely stalled draft
# for one more cycle. A PR either of whose nested collections came back at `gh
# pr list`'s 100-item cap is excluded the same way (see the note at the fetch
# below): a capped response may be missing the newest activity, and incomplete
# data is not licence to guess either.
