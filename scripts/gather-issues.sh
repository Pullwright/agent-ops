# gather-issues.sh — deterministically pre-fetch one repo's open issues, whole
# threads included, for the Co-Ordinator's runtime input
# (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md, requirement 3j).
#
# Usage: gather-issues.sh <owner/repo>
#
# Prints one JSON object, `{"candidates": […], "excluded": […]|null}`:
#
# `candidates` — one entry per candidate issue:
#
#   {
#     "source": "issues",
#     "ref": "125",                  // the bare issue number — the item ref
#     "number": 125,
#     "url": "https://github.com/…/issues/125",
#     "title": "…",
#     "priority": "Medium",          // the Priority band, default Medium (15e)
#     "priority_set": false,         // true iff any option is set on the field, even one
#                                     // outside the four recognised names (requirement 39g)
#     "labels": ["…"],
#     "author": "…",
#     "created_at": "…", "updated_at": "…",
#     "body": "…verbatim…",
#     "comments": [{"author": "…", "created_at": "…", "body": "…verbatim…"}]
#   }
#
# `excluded` — one entry per issue the deterministic filter below dropped
# (requirement 16.4's deterministic half; agent-ops#447), each
# `{"number": 125, "reason": "assigned" | "blocked-label" | "blocked-by: <ref>"}`
# — never a PR the issues endpoint interleaves, which is dropped unreported
# because it was never a candidate issue to begin with. This is what lets a
# caller report "N issues excluded, and why" instead of a drop nothing else
# ever recorded: before this, the three deterministic drops removed an issue
# from candidacy with nothing on stdout, nothing on stderr, and nothing in
# the shared log to say it had happened. `excluded` is `null`, never `[]`,
# when the deterministic filter did not run to completion (see "Degrading"
# below) — an empty array asserts "gathered, and nothing was excluded",
# which a failed or partial gather does not know to be true (review decision
# on agent-ops#452 concern 3).
#
# An issue labelled `pw::type:tech-debt` is dropped from `candidates` too
# (D15 as revised, #869; issue #875), on the same unreported terms as a pull
# request: it belongs to the `tech-debt` band instead
# (scripts/gather-tech-debt.sh), so it was never an `issues` candidate to
# begin with, and keeping the two bands disjoint is not a deterministic-filter
# drop `excluded` needs to explain.
#
# ## Why issues are pre-fetched at all
#
# The issues source used to be the Co-Ordinator's own read: the prompt said
# "query the issues API yourself", and nothing in the runtime input carried a
# single issue. That contract turned out to fail closed in the worst way: a
# cycle was observed (20260727T145500Z-poetic-1-1431114) in which the
# Co-Ordinator, seeing pre-fetched arrays for every *other* source, reasoned
# "no issue data provided in input; per the prompt, I do not re-query" — a
# rule that never existed — and skipped the entire issues walk while six
# selectable issues sat open. A source the model can silently decline to read
# is the model-side twin of the fingerprint gap requirement 3b warns about:
# no error, no alert, just tidy none-selected events over live work. Handing
# the candidates over pre-fetched, like every source that has drifted this
# way before (findings, review-feedback, merge-conflicts, abandoned-drafts),
# removes the ambiguity instead of wording it away.
#
# ## What is filtered here, and what is not
#
# Requirement 16's issue exclusion has two halves. The *deterministic* half —
# an issue that is assigned, or labelled `blocked` (case-insensitive), or
# names an unresolved `Blocked-by:` dependency (requirement 34j, checked
# further down once each candidate's thread is in hand) — is applied here, so
# the Co-Ordinator never spends judgement on entries no rule would let it
# pick; pull requests (which the issues endpoint also returns) are dropped
# the same way. The *judgement* half — "a question or discussion rather than
# actionable work", read over the whole thread — cannot be a jq filter, and
# stays the Co-Ordinator's (requirement 16.4), which is exactly why
# requirement 3x obliges it to *report* that judgement in `needs_refinement`
# rather than skip in silence: it is the one decline in any pre-fetched band
# nothing here can record, and an unrecorded decline is a band the Script's
# own verdict corroboration cannot check. Items blocked in the shared
# log are NOT dropped here: the Co-Ordinator holds the blocked list and
# requirement 18a's re-check needs the issue's thread and `updated_at` in
# front of it to decide whether fresh evidence unblocks it.
#
# The `priority` field is read exactly as gather-source-state.sh reads it for
# the fingerprint digest — same field, same four names, same Medium default —
# because if the two disagreed, the digest would be stable while the
# candidate set changed (or the reverse), which is the failure requirement 3b
# exists to prevent. `priority_set` is this script's own addition, not
# gather-source-state.sh's, and reads the field more broadly than `priority`
# does on purpose: `priority` alone collapses "unset", "unreadable" and
# "explicitly Medium" into the same value (deliberately — it must agree with
# the Co-Ordinator's own default), so the Refiner's triage candidate rule
# (requirement 39g, `refiner_candidate_items`) needs this second boolean to
# tell an untriaged issue from a deliberately-Medium one at all — and it must
# be true for *any single-select option* a human or agent chose, including
# one outside the four names this pipeline ranks (an org admin can add a
# fifth at any time), or that issue reads as untriaged forever and never
# leaves the triage queue even once someone has banded it (agent-ops#509).
# A `Priority` field value carrying no `single_select_option` at all (GitHub
# also emits text/date/etc. field-value shapes; an admin can retype the
# field to a different type) contributes nothing to `$priority_names` — the
# `select(. != null)` guard drops it — so it reads as unset, not set
# (agent-ops#527).
#
# ## Degrading, and the 100-item windows
#
# Like gather-findings.sh — and unlike gather-source-state.sh — this output
# is *given to* the Co-Ordinator, so degrading `candidates` to `[]` (exit 0)
# on any API failure is safe: the fingerprint then faithfully records "the
# Co-Ordinator saw no issues", and the source-state issues digest, sampled
# independently, still busts the fingerprint when a real issue changes.
# `excluded` degrades to `null`, not `[]` — the caller's on-change
# `issues-excluded` logging (agent-cycle.sh, requirement 33) treats `null` as
# "unknown, do not compare" rather than as a release from exclusion, which an
# empty array would otherwise fabricate on every ordinary `gh` hiccup (review
# decision on agent-ops#452 concern 3). Failures are loud on stderr (teed
# into the cycle record as issues-<repo>.err) for the same reason
# gather-review-feedback.sh's are: an empty result indistinguishable from "no
# open issues" once cost a debugging round.
#
# `issue_prefetch_open_issues` (lib/issue-prefetch.sh, agent-ops#1085) pages
# the open-issues walk itself up to its own stated cap (2000 issues); each
# issue's own comment thread takes one 100-comment window, the newest 100
# where a thread runs longer — a thread past that, or a repository past the
# page cap, is a repo-hygiene problem before it is a gathering one, but both
# bounds are stated in that function's own header so nobody has to
# rediscover either from a truncated thread.

# The deterministic filter and the entry shape. `issue_deterministic_ok`
# (lib/issue-prefetch.sh, shared with scripts/gather-tech-debt.sh) drops the
# PRs the issues endpoint interleaves — never reported in `excluded`, since a
# PR was never a candidate issue to begin with — assigned issues (requirement
# 16.4's deterministic half — this also covers the Enabler's escalation
# issues, which are always assigned), and issues labelled `blocked` whatever
# their case. A `pw::type:tech-debt`-labelled issue is dropped too, the same
# way a PR is: it belongs to the `tech-debt` band instead (scripts/
# gather-tech-debt.sh), so keeping the two bands disjoint (D15 as revised,
# #869) is not a candidacy exclusion to report in `excluded` any more than a
# PR's own drop is — it was never an `issues` candidate to begin with.
# `priority`'s parse mirrors gather-source-state.sh verbatim; `priority_set`
# reads the same field more broadly, from the raw option names
# (`$priority_names`) rather than the filtered `$priority_values`, so it is
# true for any single-select option at all, not only the four ranked names —
# but not for a `Priority` value with no `single_select_option` at all, which
# `$priority_names` drops.
#
# `excluded` mirrors the assigned/blocked-label drops only, reason-tagged
# (agent-ops#447): assigned wins the tag when an issue is somehow both
# assigned and `blocked`-labelled, matching the order `issue_exclude_reason`
# checks them in.
#
# A third, structured drop happens below, once each candidate's whole thread
# is in hand: a `Blocked-by:` reference (requirement 34j) naming a still-open
# issue or pull request holds the candidate back the same way —
# deterministically, before the Co-Ordinator ever sees it — so an item
# declaring a dependency never earns a judgement, or an `attempt-failed`,
# while that dependency stands. It is appended to `excluded` in the loop
# below, once the unresolved reference is known.
