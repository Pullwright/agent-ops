# ready for review or ready to merge but blocked by a conflict with their base
# (requirement 3g), plus Dependabot's own conflicted bumps (requirement 3s,
# issue #250).
#
# Given a repo slug, print a JSON array of merge-conflict candidates: open,
# *non-draft* PRs whose `mergeable` is definitively CONFLICTING, and which are
# either ours (this system raised them) or Dependabot's own. Each is
# finished-looking work that a human is (implicitly or explicitly) waiting to
# land, held up only by the base branch having advanced underneath it — a
# rebase-and-resolve away from mergeable again, or (for Dependabot's own PRs,
# which this system does not force-push) a bot-aware nudge-then-takeover away.

#                                 // a `voided` entry (see the note below)
#
# ## Why the Script fetches this and not the Co-Ordinator
#
# Same three reasons as gather-review-feedback.sh (requirement 3c) and
# gather-abandoned-drafts.sh (requirement 3e), and — as there — the third is the
# one that matters:
#   1. Cost, as with gather-findings.sh (requirement 3a): mergeability is a field
#      on the PR list, not something worth a model turn to reason out.
#   2. The PR's own body is the brief the Implementer finishes against, and must
#      reach it verbatim, not summarised.
#   3. The candidate rule below has to exist in the fingerprint (requirement 3b)
#      regardless, and requirement 34a says a rule two components compute gets one
#      definition. This script is it — and, as with abandoned-drafts, this source
#      is the reason PR mergeability is fingerprinted at all (see the note on the
#      clock-like transition below).
#
# ## The candidate rule
#
# A PR is a candidate iff it is open, **not** a draft, and `mergeable` is
# exactly `CONFLICTING` (never the transient `UNKNOWN` — GitHub computes
# mergeability asynchronously, so a PR whose base just moved reads UNKNOWN for
# a beat; treating that as a conflict would send the Implementer to rebase a
# PR that may not even conflict), and either:
#   - **ours**: it carries <pr-label> and its head branch starts with
#     <branch-prefix> — i.e. this
#     system raised it. The Landing Gate reserves every other branch for
#     humans; force-pushing a rebase onto a human's branch because it had
#     drifted would be a memorable way to learn that. Or,
#   - **Dependabot's own**: its author is `app/dependabot`
#     (`$DEPENDABOT_LOGIN`, lib/dependabot-bump.sh). Dependabot's branches
#     carry neither <pr-label> nor <branch-prefix> — they are the bot's, not
#     ours — so this half of the rule is authorship-based, not label-based.
#     This system never force-pushes a Dependabot branch (see
#     scripts/nudge-dependabot-rebase.sh); a `bot` candidate's `branch`
#     stays the bot's own, informational only.
#
# ## Rebase-requested and supersession, for a `bot` candidate
#
# `rebase_requested` is read, never written, here: it is true iff a comment
# already on the PR carries `dependabot_rebase_marker` for *this exact* head
# SHA (12 hex chars) — the same scoping the `ref` below uses, so a rebase that
# actually moves the head (successful or not) retires the old marker's
# relevance and a fresh conflict at the same head still matches the marker
# already there instead of asking again. scripts/nudge-dependabot-rebase.sh is
# what posts that comment and only for a candidate this script reports
# `rebase_requested: false` for — one definition of the rule (requirement
# 34a), read by one script and acted on by the other.
#
# `superseded_by` compares this PR's Dependabot branch against every other
# open Dependabot PR in the same read (`dependabot_newer_open_pr`,
# lib/dependabot-bump.sh): same family (dependency + package manager, read off
# the branch name), strictly newer target version. When set, `superseded_evidence`
# is pre-formatted so a Co-Ordinator can paste it into a `voided` entry's
# `evidence` **verbatim** rather than composing its own citation: the guard
# that corroborates a void (lib/void-guard.sh) treats "PR #N" — bare, or as a
# `.../pull/N` URL, either one resolved live (issue #300) — as a claim that PR
# *implements* the item, and checks its body and branch for the item's own id
# — which the superseding PR will never carry (it is a different, independent
# bump). Citing this PR's *own* number is what the guard trusts on the id
# alone for a `pr-<n>-…` item cited in the entry's own repo, as a bare
# citation always is (its id is minted from that very PR), so the
# pre-formatted text below cites this PR's number for that reason and names
# the superseding PR only by its branch name — neither "PR #N" nor a
# `.../pull/N` URL, both of which the guard would fetch live and refuse, since
# a different, independent bump never carries this item's id — precise, not
# evasive: the claim being corroborated is "this PR (its own number) is
# superseded", not "that PR did this PR's work".
#
# ## Why mergeability must be sampled here, and fed to the fingerprint verbatim
#
# A PR turns CONFLICTING when its base advances — someone merged another PR to
# `main` — but that is not an event on *this* PR: no commit lands on its head, its
# `updatedAt` does not move, and gather-source-state.sh's open-PR digest (which
# keys on number, updated_at, head ref and draft flag) sits unchanged. Worse, the
# base advance and the conflict appearing are two separate moments: the cycle the
# base moved, the repo head SHA changed and the fingerprint busted, but GitHub had
# not yet recomputed mergeability (UNKNOWN), so nothing was gathered; a later cycle
# the mergeability resolves to CONFLICTING with the repo head SHA unchanged since —
# so without this array the fingerprint would match the earlier none-selected and
# the pipeline would skip the very cycle the work becomes visible, until the forced
# recheck. Computing candidacy here and feeding the resulting array into the
# fingerprint verbatim (as agent-cycle.sh does for review_feedback and
# abandoned_drafts) is what makes the transition visible: the array gains an entry
# the cycle mergeability resolves to CONFLICTING, and that busts the fingerprint.
# Same shape as abandoned-drafts' clock-based candidacy. See lib/noop-skip.sh.
#
# A `bot` candidate's `rebase_requested` flip (false -> true, the cycle after
# scripts/nudge-dependabot-rebase.sh posts its comment) is exactly the same
# kind of transition: no commit lands, `updatedAt` barely moves, but the
# candidate becomes a *takeover* candidate the Co-Ordinator can select. Reading
# this array here, unconditionally, every cycle, is what makes both transitions
# visible to the no-op fingerprint.
#
# ## Why the ref is scoped to the head SHA
#
# `pr-<n>-conflict-<head-sha>`, not `pr-<n>-conflict`. An item recorded blocked
# (requirement 34) stays blocked until something clears it, so a bare
# `pr-<n>-conflict` that an Implementer once failed to resolve would still be
# blocked after fresh commits landed on the branch — and the new state, which
# might be trivially resolvable, would never be looked at again. Scoping the ref
# to the head SHA means each distinct conflicted state is its own item that no
# older block covers, while a resolution (which moves the head) naturally retires
# the ref, and a conflict re-detected at the *same* head keeps the same ref and
# stays correctly blocked. Same reasoning as abandoned-drafts' per-head refs and
# review-feedback's per-round refs: an unattended system expires items by
# irrelevance.
#
# The same head-sha scoping applies to the `pr-<n>-superseded-<head-sha>` shape
# a superseded Dependabot candidate mints instead: a fresh commit on that PR's
# branch (a rebase, say) mints a fresh ref just as it would for the conflict
# shape, so a stale void of an earlier head never suppresses a state nobody has
# looked at.
#
# Fails safe: always prints a valid JSON array and exits 0. A repo with no
# conflicted PRs contributes `[]`; an API that will not answer contributes `[]`
# too (the source simply does not fire this cycle) — but note gather-source-state.sh
# must NOT be so relaxed about the same PRs, for the reason it documents.
#
