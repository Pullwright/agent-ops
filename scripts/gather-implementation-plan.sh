# gather-implementation-plan.sh — deterministically pre-fetch the open
# (unchecked) tasks in a repo's implementation-plan document, for the
# Refiner (docs/spec/implementation/requirements, requirement 3y;
# TD-PPagop-26081307).
#
# Usage: gather-implementation-plan.sh <owner/repo> <default-branch> <path>
#
# Prints a JSON array; each entry is one candidate task:
#
#   {
#     "source": "implementation-plan",
#     "ref": "W10-breach-handling",   // the task's own id, as it appears in the document
#     "id": "W10-breach-handling",
#     "title": "…the text after the id on the task-list line…",
#     "url": "https://github.com/…/blob/main/docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md",
#     "body": "…the whole task-list line, verbatim…"
#   }
#
# In document order (the plan's own task sequence, not sorted).
#
# ## Deliberately narrower than gather-tech-debt.sh
#
# This does not decide which task is *next* (the Co-Ordinator's own live
# read, prompts/coordinator.md, does that — "the next unblocked task(s) in
# that repo's plan document") and does not follow any dependency between
# tasks: every open task-list line is a candidate, in document order, and
# the usual `refinement_policy`/refined/blocked/void/claimed exclusions in
# `refiner_candidate_items` decide the rest.
#
# ## Only a whole-word id, in the same shape work-gone.sh already commits to
#
# A task-list line counts only when it opens with a bullet and an empty
# checkbox (`- [ ]`, `* [ ]`, `1. [ ]`) followed by an id matching
# `WORK_GONE_PLAN_RE` (lib/work-gone.sh) — the same shape
# `work_gone_plan_ids` uses to route a blocked ref back to this document, so
# an id this gatherer mints is always one a later block on it can be
# resolved against. A line whose leading token isn't that shape is not a
# task this pipeline can track by id, and is skipped rather than guessed at.
#
# Degrades to `[]` (exit 0) on any failure, like gather-tech-debt.sh: a
# missing or unreadable document (a repo's `implementation_plan_path`
# pointing at a file since deleted or renamed) is silent; a genuine API
# failure is loud on stderr.
