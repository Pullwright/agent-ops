#
# scripts/check-graphql-drift.sh — validate every GraphQL document this
# repository sends against GitHub's *live* schema (TD-PPagop-26082930).
#
# The gap this closes: every GitHub read in `lib/` is exercised only through a
# `gh` stub this repository writes, and a stub answers in whatever shape its
# own fixture declares. A field GitHub renames, moves or removes therefore
# cannot fail a test — the suite stays green and the only symptom is a stage
# refusing at runtime, in wording that names the gate rather than the cause.
# That is not hypothetical: GitHub moved `mergeMethod` and `mergingStrategy`
# off `MergeQueue` onto `MergeQueue.configuration` between 2026-08-16 and
# 2026-08-23, GraphQL rejects the *whole* document for one unknown field, and
# `lib/merge-queue.sh`'s `merge_queue_for_branch` — which asked for both and
# read neither — returned non-zero on every call for the six days that
# followed. `landing_arm` turned each into its gate-7 refusal, so the fleet's
# first autonomous landing waited on two fields nobody read, while nothing
# failed and nothing alerted.
#
# So this asks GitHub itself, on a schedule, and the answer is only ever as
# current as the last run.
#
# HOW A DOCUMENT IS CHECKED WITHOUT BEING RUN. Two of these documents are
# mutations — `enqueuePullRequest` (lib/landing.sh) and `setIssueFieldValue`
# (lib/issue-priority.sh) — and a checker that ran what it checks would
# enqueue a pull request every night. GraphQL validates a document in full
# *before* executing any of it, so each operation's selection set is wrapped
# in an untyped inline fragment carrying `@skip(if:true)`:
#
#   mutation($id:ID!){ ... @skip(if:true) { enqueuePullRequest(…){ … } } }
#
# Validation still walks every field inside the fragment and still reports an
# unknown one; execution collects no fields at all and answers `{"data":{}}`.
# Verified live, 2026-08-29, against GitHub's own endpoint on all four
# corners: the wrapper leaves a good document clean; an unknown field nested
# inside it is still reported as `undefinedField`; the same mutation *without*
# the wrapper does resolve its argument (`NOT_FOUND` on a bogus node id),
# which is what proves the wrapper is the thing preventing execution; and the
# pre-fix `mergeQueue(branch:$branch){ id mergeMethod mergingStrategy }`
# selection set is reported field by field — this check, had it existed, would
# have failed on 2026-08-23 instead of six days later.
#
# Two rejected alternatives, both tried live first. Sending a bogus
# `operationName` short-circuits before validation ("No operation named …")
# and reports nothing about the document at all — it is the silent pass this
# whole item exists to retire. Putting `@skip` on each top-level field
# directly needs the field's arguments parsed to find where the directive
# goes; wrapping the operation's own selection set needs only its braces
# matched, and covers every top-level field at once rather than the first.
#
# THE REQUEST IS A JSON BODY, not `-f query=…` arguments. `gh api graphql`
# builds one map from every `-f`/`-F` pair and lifts all but `query` into
# `variables`, so a document declaring a variable actually named `$query` (or
# `$operationName`) collides with the reserved key that carries the document
# itself: gh 2.96.0 refuses the call outright with `unexpected override
# existing field under "query"`, and other versions resolve it last-wins and
# send the placeholder *as* the document. Either way a perfectly valid
# document reads as this check's own failure, which is precisely what the
# variable table below refuses to risk. GitHub's own canonical search form
# (`query($query:String!, …){ search(query:$query, …) }`) is the obvious way
# to trip it. Building `{query, variables}` and posting it with
# `--input` has no reserved key, and carries variable *types* through JSON
# rather than through `-f`-versus-`-F`. The body goes to a temp file rather
# than to `--input -`, because the wrapper below retries a rate-limited call
# and a retry cannot re-read a consumed stdin.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT CATCH. Validation answers "does this document still mean
# something to the schema", not "does it still mean the same thing": a field
# that kept its name and type while changing what it returns, an argument
# whose default moved, an enum that gained a value. Those stay the runtime's
# problem. It does catch — beyond a removed or moved field — a field that
# gained or lost a selection set, an argument that no longer exists, and a
# variable declared at a type the argument no longer accepts. That last one is
# agent-ops#737 exactly, where `$optionId:String!` against an `ID` argument
# failed every Priority write the fleet attempted; it is reported here as
# `variableMismatch`, and was confirmed so live.
#
# DISCOVERY IS A SEARCH, NEVER A LIST, and it is checked from the other side.
# The documents are found by walking the tree for `-f query='`, the one form
# all of them use, rather than from a list somebody maintains — for the
# reason every drift check of this kind eventually learns about its own
# manifest: a
# hard-coded list can only cover what someone already thought to add to it, so
# the document added tomorrow is invisible to the very check meant to cover
# it. But a search keyed on one spelling is a list of whoever happened to
# write that spelling, and `-f query="…"`, `--field query=…` or a document
# assembled in a variable would all be just as idiomatic and just as
# invisible. So every file that mentions `api graphql` at all must yield at
# least one document, and a file that mentions it and yields none fails the
# run. Finding *no* document anywhere fails too, and a file that opens a
# document it never closes fails rather than contributing nothing. None of
# these is ever a quiet pass. `prompts/` counts as a source of documents:
# those are sent by the agents this repository operates, and
# `prompts/reviewer.md`'s merge-queue probe guards a push that cannot be
# undone.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/check-graphql-drift.sh            # check every document
#   ./scripts/check-graphql-drift.sh --list     # print what would be checked
#
# Environment: GRAPHQL_DRIFT_GH overrides `gh` and GRAPHQL_DRIFT_ROOT the tree
# searched (the test uses both).
#
# Exit 0: every document validates.
# Exit 1: at least one document is wrong — a field, argument or variable type
#   GitHub no longer recognises, a document whose shape this cannot read, or a
#   variable type it cannot synthesise a value for.
# Exit 2: at least one document was not checked at all — none found, a file
#   that mentions `api graphql` and yields no document, an unterminated
#   document, no `gh`, no credentials, or GitHub unreachable or refusing.
# Where both apply, **2 wins**: a run that could not answer for every document
# has not established the "no drift" half of its verdict either, and saying 1
# would claim a survey it did not complete. Any drift found is still printed
# and annotated. Unable is never reported as clean, and never as drift.
# `--list`'s own exit status reports only whether it could list (0 listed
# something, 2 nothing to list); it validates nothing, so it never returns 1.

#
# The opening delimiter is `-f query='` **at an argv token boundary** — start
# of line, or preceded by whitespace — and the closing one is the next `'`.
# The closing rule is exact rather than approximate: these are single-quoted
# *shell* strings, and a single-quoted shell string cannot contain a single
# quote. The boundary rule is what keeps prose out: a prompt file explaining
# the form writes it inside a Markdown code span, where the character before
# `-f` is a backtick, and without the rule that prose opens a document whose
# closing quote is the *real* call's own — emitting the prose as one garbage
# document and swallowing the query that mattered.
#
# A document still open at end of file is reported rather than dropped. That
# is the silent pass this whole item is about: a typographic quote instead of
# an apostrophe used to make `awk` run to EOF and print nothing, so the file
# contributed no documents while the global "found nothing" guard stayed
# quiet because other files had.
#
# In awk rather than in bash, which is not a style preference: the bash form
# this replaced walked each file with `${rest#…}` and counted the newlines in
# the consumed prefix with `${prefix//[!$'\n']/}`, both of which rescan the
# whole prefix on every document, and it spent 39 seconds of CPU on this

# --- rewriting -------------------------------------------------------------

# definitions (empty when it declares none). Returns non-zero, saying why on
# stderr, when the document's shape is not one this checker recognises —
# which fails the run rather than skipping the document, since a document this
# cannot rewrite is a document nothing is checking. The three reasons are
# distinct and are passed through to the annotation by the caller: they point
# at different ends of the document and have different fixes.
#
# Brace and paren matching is by depth, and both are safe here: the only
# braces inside an operation are its own selection sets and input-object
# literals (`input:{pullRequestId:$id}`), all balanced. A GraphQL *string*
# literal containing an unbalanced brace would defeat it; none of these
# documents has a string literal at all, and one appearing would show up as

# Every regular file in the tree, less `.git` and `node_modules`, and less

#     asking, and test/graphql-drift.test.sh's own fixtures include documents
#     deliberately broken to prove this check reports them;
#   - this file, which quotes the delimiter throughout its commentary above;
#   - Markdown outside `prompts/` — CHANGELOG.md, docs/, README.md — which is
#     prose *about* these documents rather than any of them. `prompts/` is the
#     deliberate exception and not an oversight: a prompt file is the
#     instruction an agent carries out, so its documents are sent as surely as
#     `lib/`'s.
#
# Note what is *not* excluded: any shell script anywhere in the tree, whether
# or not whoever added it knew this check exists.
#
# A tree walk rather than `git ls-files`, which is how `scripts/lint-shell.sh`
# beside it discovers its own file set. Because this check has to be able to
# run where it is tested, and it is tested inside the node image: the `test/`
# suite runs from `/app` in a container built with a `.dockerignore` that
# drops `.git`, and `scripts/run-tests.sh` tars the working tree in with
# `--exclude=.git` for the same reason. Discovery keyed on an index would find
# nothing there and report it as no drift, so the one case worth having — the
# real tree, walked the way the nightly walks it — could only ever have been
# asserted on a developer's checkout. That is the shape of the failure this
# whole item is about. What tracking would have bought is that an untracked
