# rotate-logs.sh — bound the diagnostic and cron logs beside state_dir's
# records (TD26072501).
#
# TD26072004 (scripts/state-sync.sh) bounded the *records* in state_dir —
# cycles/ and reviews/ are pruned on every push — but left the logs beside
# them appended to forever. The heartbeat is the worst of them by two orders
# of magnitude: one line per tick, growing megabytes a day and never
# stopping.
#
# Rotation here is intentionally narrow, because the logs in state_dir are
# not interchangeable:
#
#   dashboard.log, state-sync.log,  pure diagnostics, excluded from the
#   doctor.log, revert-rate.log,   state branch (scripts/state-sync.sh) —
#   tech-debt-archive.log,         safe to rotate on size alone. doctor.log
#   wake-poll.log                   is the hourly `doctor.sh --unattended`
#                                   pass's own text output (agent-ops#543);
#                                   the dashboard reads the structured
#                                   .doctor-status.json beside it, not this
#                                   file, so rotating it costs nothing an
#                                   operator watches for. revert-rate.log is
#                                   the daily `publish-revert-rate.sh` pass's
#                                   own text output (agent-ops#579), the same
#                                   role doctor.log plays for `doctor.sh
#                                   --unattended`: the dashboard reads the
#                                   structured revert-rate.jsonl beside it,
#                                   not this file. tech-debt-archive.log is
#                                   the daily `publish-tech-debt-archive.sh`
#                                   pass's own text output (agent-ops#878) —
#                                   this one has no structured local
#                                   counterpart at all, since what it
#                                   publishes lands in the state repository
#                                   itself (`tech-debt-archive/`), not in a
#                                   local file beside this log. wake-poll.log
#                                   is scripts/wake-poll.sh's own text output
#                                   (requirement 54, issue #613) and the
#                                   fastest-growing of this group: one line
#                                   every schedule.wake_poll_minutes, quiet
#                                   ticks included. Its one structured record
#                                   — the `wake-poll-triggered` event — goes
#                                   to log.jsonl, which is never rotated, so
#                                   bounding this file loses no decision.
#   cron.log, review-cron.log       published to the node's state branch, so
#                                   bounding them here also bounds the
#                                   mirror. scripts/publish-dashboard.sh
#                                   renders cron.log's tail in the cron
#                                   panel, so it reads the previous
#                                   generation too when the live file is
#                                   short — rotating here never has to keep
#                                   a tail of its own.
#   gh-shim/ledger.ndjson           the `gh` transport shim's per-call ledger
#                                   (requirement 2.0e, agent-ops#1084) —
#                                   published to the node's state branch like
#                                   cron.log above, but nothing in this
#                                   pipeline makes a decision from it: only
#                                   scripts/github-budget-report.sh reads it,
#                                   as one more telemetry source, so rotating
#                                   it bounds that report's history and
#                                   nothing else.
#   log.jsonl, review-log.jsonl,    NEVER rotated. This is the fleet's
#   monitor-log.jsonl,              memory: the union readers (blocked/void
#   revert-rate.jsonl               
#                                   extraction, the no-op fingerprint, the
#                                   limit cooldown, the revert-rate panel)
#                                   scan it whole, and dropping its head
#                                   would silently change what the
#                                   Co-Ordinator believes has been tried, or
#                                   which node's revert-rate row is newest.
#
# Plain rename is enough: every writer here reopens the file by name on each
# append (`>>"$log"` per cron invocation), so nothing holds a stale
# descriptor across a rotation and copytruncate is not needed.
#
# Meant to run from its own crontab line (deploy/docker/crontab.tmpl),
# independent of the pipelines it tidies up after.

Rotate the diagnostic and cron logs in state_dir once they exceed
log_retained_bytes, keeping log_generations of history. log.jsonl,
review-log.jsonl, monitor-log.jsonl and revert-rate.jsonl are never touched.

Environment:
  ROTATE_LOGS_RETAINED_BYTES   override log_retained_bytes (tests use a
                               small value).
  ROTATE_LOGS_GENERATIONS      override log_generations.
