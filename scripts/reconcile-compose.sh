# scripts/reconcile-compose.sh — the compose reconciler's one tick.
#
# Watchtower keeps a node's *image* current with `main` without anyone
# visiting the host. Nothing kept its *compose.yaml* current, because an image
# roll recreates a container from the old container's Config: a merged
# compose change — a label, a service's environment, a mount, a whole new
# service — reached a node only when a human ran `docker compose up -d` there.
# This is the deterministic actor that closes that gap. No model is in this
# path; the file it installs is the one the image shipped, byte for byte.
#
# The decision logic lives in lib/compose-reconcile.sh, which is where the
# tests reach it with `docker` stubbed. This script is the crontab's entry
# point: it resolves the three paths from config.json and prints a line a
# human reading `docker compose logs reconciler` can act on.
#
# It runs in the `reconciler` service (deploy/docker/compose.yaml, profile
# `auto-update`) on the schedule in deploy/docker/reconcile-crontab. It needs
# the Docker socket and the node's own project directory bind-mounted at the
# same absolute path it has on the host — see that service, and
# `AGENT_OPS_PROJECT_DIR` in .env.example.
#
# Usage: reconcile-compose.sh [--print | --audit]
#
#   --print   print the verdict JSON and change nothing else (there is no
#             "dry run": the verdict is computed the same way either way, and
#             this flag only suppresses the human line, for a caller that
#             wants the object).
#   --audit   run no tick: read the last verdict back and say, one
#             `<class> <message>` line per finding, whether this node can
#             apply the next merged compose.yaml (`compose_reconcile_audit`).
#             What scripts/check-node-compose.sh asks from the host.
#
# Exit status is 0 on every verdict, including `refused`. Nothing reads a
# cron job's exit status on this image, and a refusal is a recorded state, not
# a crashed script — the verdict travels in the heartbeat and onto every
# dashboard (IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC requirement 2.5a). Exit 2 is a usage
# error alone.
