# scripts/release-pending-reservations.sh — retry a tech-debt reservation
# release a failed cleanup could not make land (TD-PPagop-26082427).
#
# The cleanup in question was `lib/tech-debt-file.sh`'s `_techdebt_unfile`, on
# `techdebt_file_debt`'s id-reservation filing path. It ran once, on that
# function's own failure path, against the same GitHub API whose failure just
# put it there — a transient window that failed a filing's branch-create or
# contents-write call is the same window that could fail the DELETE meant to
# undo it. Nothing before this script ever retried that DELETE:
# `scripts/sweep-orphan-branches.sh` leaves a bare `td/<id>` reservation
# branch alone (issue #545, since it cannot tell whether <id> has since been
# filed elsewhere — and, since #882 retired the `td/` namespace from that
# walk, it no longer lists the namespace at all), and the release workflow
# that once swept them only ever fired for a `td/<id>` whose record actually
# reached `main` — an id that was reserved and then
# abandoned never got that push. Left uncovered, a reservation orphaned this
# way is "left for good", the exact phrase `lib/tech-debt-file.sh`'s own
# header used to concede before this script existed: observed for real on
# this repository, fourteen consecutive reservations (TD-PPagop-26082407
# through TD-PPagop-26082420) orphaned in one seventy-second window on
# 2026-08-23, each one that cleanup's own failed DELETE.
#
# agent-ops#874 retired the whole reservation path — `techdebt_file_debt`
# files a `pw::type:tech-debt`-labelled issue now, with no id, no branch and
# so no cleanup — so nothing writes a fresh marker any more and this sweep
# only ever has pre-#874 ones left to drain (agent-ops#1219). A marker, while
# any remains, is one JSON file per pending release under
# `reservation-releases/<repo>/<branch>.json` in the state
# repository (the same `state_repo` `lib/claim.sh`'s own claim registry
# already lives in, under its own `claims/` tree). This script is the other
# half: every cycle (lib/standdown.sh, step 2.1g), fleet-wide regardless of
# `--repo`, it walks that tree, retries each marker's own delete, and clears
# the marker once the branch is confirmed gone — by this retry, by a peer
# node's concurrent retry, or by anything else that already deleted it
# (a human's own `git push --delete`, now that nothing else sweeps `td/`).
# A delete that fails again leaves the marker in place for the next cycle's
# pass, so recovery costs no more than time: the marker survives until a
# transient GitHub failure finally clears, or a human deletes the branch by
# hand and lets this script notice on its next pass.
#
# Requires no repository argument: every marker names its own target repo,
# so one invocation walks every pending release in the state repository
# regardless of which repositories this installation is configured against.
# A no-op when `state_repo` is unset — the same single-node reading
# `lib/claim.sh`'s own registry gives it.
#
# Output: one JSON object per marker examined, on stdout —
#   {"action":"released","repo":…,"branch":…}
#   {"action":"absent","repo":…,"branch":…}
#   {"action":"warning","repo":…,"branch":…,"detail":…}
# The caller logs them; this script logs nothing itself. Always exits 0 — a
# branch this script fails to delete must not fail the cycle it runs inside;
# the marker it leaves behind is what stands behind it.
#
# Usage: release-pending-reservations.sh
# Environment: RELEASE_PENDING_GH overrides `gh` (tests stub it);
# AGENT_OPS_CONFIG overrides the config path, as review-cycle.sh accepts it.
