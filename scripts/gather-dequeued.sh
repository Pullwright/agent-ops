# gather-dequeued.sh — pre-fetch a repo's pull requests this system raised
# that GitHub's merge queue removed over a *merge-group* checks failure
# without merging (TD-PPagop-26081409, issue #374, requirement 38f/D17).
#
# A merge queue dequeues a pull request whose own head is green but whose
# speculative merge with whatever sat ahead of it in the queue failed a
# required check — a real defect in the pull request, of exactly the kind
# requirement 3g already fixes autonomously when git surfaces it as a
# textual conflict instead. `scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh` already
# notices every dequeue and tells a human (requirement 38f) — that notice
# fires for any dequeue reason and is unconditional here, per the design this
# script implements. What nothing did before this file is turn the
# pipeline-actionable half of that — a checks-failure dequeue — into work the
# Co-Ordinator can select: this script is that other half.
#
# Given a repo slug, print a JSON array of candidates: open, *non-draft* PRs
# carrying <pr-label> whose head branch is ours (<branch-prefix>),
# which GitHub's merge queue most recently removed for a merge-group checks
# failure and has not since re-queued, and which are not already conflicting
# against their base (that is requirement 3g's own candidate — see "Why this
# source and merge-conflicts never overlap" below).

#
# ## The candidate rule
#
# A PR is a candidate iff it is open, **not** a draft, carries <pr-label>,
# its head branch starts with <branch-prefix> — i.e. this system raised it,
# the same "ours" test
# gather-merge-conflicts.sh applies, since force-pushing a fix onto a
# human's own branch is exactly what the Landing Gate reserves every other
# branch against — and:
#
#   - its `mergeable` reads exactly `MERGEABLE` (never `CONFLICTING`, which
#     is requirement 3g's own candidate and must stay that script's alone —
#     see below — and never the transient `UNKNOWN`, for the same reason
#     gather-merge-conflicts.sh never admits it: GitHub computes mergeability
#     asynchronously, and a PR whose base just moved reads `UNKNOWN` for a
#     beat that is not yet a fact this script can act on); and
#   - `lib/merge-queue.sh`'s `merge_queue_probe` reports `queued: false` and
#     a non-null `dequeued_at` — it was removed from the queue and has not
#     been re-queued since; and
#   - `dequeue_reason` reads, case-insensitively, exactly `failed_checks` —
#     the one value confirmed against a real GitHub deployment (a merge-group
#     checks failure; see the Gotchas note below). GitHub documents `reason`
#     as a free-text `String`, not a fixed enum (checked 2026-08-14 against
#     both the GraphQL schema and octokit/webhooks' own JSON Schema for the
#     `pull_request.dequeued` event — neither constrains it), so this is
#     deliberately an allow-list, not a deny-list: TD-PPagop-26081409's own
#     warning is that selecting a *human-initiated* removal would have a
#     cycle push a fix to a branch the human just took back, so an unrecognised
#     or absent reason is never a candidate, on the same "the wrong direction
#     here is unsafe" reasoning gather-merge-conflicts.sh applies to `UNKNOWN`.
#   - **the dequeue has not already been answered** — no marked
#     `actor=implementer` reply on the pull request, in a review body or a
#     general comment, is newer than `dequeued_at`. See "Why the dequeue must
#     still be unanswered" below: this is the clause that stops a fixed
#     dequeue being selected again for ever, and it is load-bearing, not a
#     refinement.
#
# A probe that cannot answer (network failure, an unreadable response) is
# never read as "not dequeued" — the one direction `merge_queue_probe`'s own
# contract forbids — so a PR whose probe fails is simply not a candidate this
# cycle, exactly as one gather-merge-conflicts.sh could not read `mergeable`
# for would not be. The reviews/comments read behind the answered clause fails
# the same way, and for a sharper reason — see that section.
#
# ## Why this source and merge-conflicts never overlap
#
# Acceptance point 6 (TD-PPagop-26081409) requires the two sources stay
# complementary, never overlapping. Requiring `mergeable == "MERGEABLE"` here
# is what guarantees it: a PR that is both dequeued *and* now conflicting
# against a base that moved further since is requirement 3g's candidate (a
# rebase is the fix it needs), not this script's — and gather-merge-
# conflicts.sh's own candidate rule already excludes anything not
# `CONFLICTING`, so the two candidate rules partition on `mergeable` and can
# never both admit the same PR head at once.
#
# ## Why the dequeue must still be unanswered
#
# Every sibling finishing source stops yielding a candidate once the pipeline
# has done its part, because the condition it keys on clears by itself: a
# rebase makes requirement 3g's `mergeable` stop reading `CONFLICTING`; any
# activity resets requirement 3e's `abandoned_draft_after_hours` clock. This
# source has neither. `RemovedFromMergeQueueEvent` is immutable timeline
# history, so `merge_queue_probe` returns the same `dequeued_at` and
# `dequeue_reason` for ever, and `isInMergeQueue` only returns to `true` when a
# *human* clicks "Merge when ready" again — which D17 deliberately reserves to
# them. So after the Implementer diagnoses the merge-group failure and pushes
# its fix, every other clause above still holds, and the only thing that has
# moved is the head SHA. The ref is scoped to that (below), so the fix does not
# retire the old ref, it *replaces* it with one no `blocked`, `void` or
# `claimed` record covers — and the pull request is offered again, at rank
# five, pointed at a merge-group run that is already fixed. Because this array
# feeds the no-op fingerprint verbatim (lib/noop-skip.sh), each replacement
# busts the fingerprint and wakes the pipeline for it.
#
# This is the failure gather-review-feedback.sh's own header calls
# load-bearing, arising here from the same root cause: the agent cannot clear
# the state it is keyed on. That script answers it by requiring the blocking
# review round to be unanswered; requirement 3z answers it the same way, via
# the same predicate — `handoff_round_answered` (lib/handoff.sh), one
# definition for the two callers that must agree on what "answered" means
# (requirement 34a).
#
# Three properties of how it is called here are deliberate:
#
#   - **The round starts at `dequeued_at`, not at the pull request's birth.**
#     Keying on the timestamp rather than on "has any implementer comment"
#     is what keeps the clause exact: a *second* dequeue after the fix stamps a
#     later `dequeued_at` than the answering comment, so the pull request
#     correctly becomes a candidate again. The clause suppresses the
#     re-selection loop without making one fixed dequeue a permanent
#     exclusion.
#   - **`REREQUESTS_JSON` is deliberately not passed.** A review-requested
#     event does not answer a dequeue, and passing the timeline would let
#     sweep-human-visibility.sh's own re-request — posted beside the very
#     requirement 38f notice this source rides alongside — read back next
#     cycle as an answer to itself (tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26080804.md). Only a
#     marked `actor=implementer` reply closes this round.
#   - **A read this cannot make yields no candidate, never "unanswered".**
#     gather-review-feedback.sh defaults an unreadable comments read to `[]`,
#     which reads as `unanswered` and *admits* its candidate; that is safe
#     there and unsafe here, because here `unanswered` is the verdict that
#     creates work. So a failed or non-array read drops the pull request for
#     this cycle, exactly as an unreadable `merge_queue_probe` does, and
#     `unknown` is never collapsed into `unanswered`.
#
# ## Why the ref is scoped to the head SHA
#
# Same reasoning as gather-merge-conflicts.sh's own `pr-<n>-conflict-<sha>`
# (see that script's header): an item recorded blocked stays blocked until
# something clears it, so a bare `pr-<n>-dequeued` that an Implementer once
# failed to resolve would still read blocked after a fresh push — including
# the Implementer's own fix — changed the very state the item names. Scoping
# to the head SHA means a block recorded against one dequeued state does not
# swallow a later, possibly-resolvable one, while a re-detected dequeue at the
# *same* head keeps the same ref and stays correctly blocked.
#
# What it does *not* do is end the pull request's candidacy: a fresh push
# replaces the ref rather than retiring it, which is the answered clause's job
# above. The two are complementary and neither substitutes for the other.
#
# Fails safe: always prints a valid JSON array and exits 0. A repo with no
# actionable dequeues contributes `[]`; an API that will not answer
# contributes `[]` too (the source simply does not fire this cycle).
#
# Environment: DEQUEUED_GH overrides `gh` (tests stub it).
