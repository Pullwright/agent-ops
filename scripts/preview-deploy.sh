# scripts/preview-deploy.sh — did this pull request's preview actually deploy,
# and does the deployed page answer?
#
# poetic-fiddle deploys from GitHub through Vercel's Git integration, so every
# pull request head SHA gets its own Preview deployment. Nothing a stage
# already looks at says whether that deployment built or serves: the Vercel
# integration reports through GitHub's *deployments* API, not through the check
# runs `gh pr checks` reads, so a pull request can be entirely green over a
# preview that failed to build. This script is how a stage asks.
#
# It exists mostly for one trap. Preview deployments sit behind Vercel
# Authentication (the project's SSO protection), and an unauthenticated request
# for one is answered with a 302 to vercel.com/login — which `curl -L` turns
# into a **200**, so any check reading a status code alone certifies a login
# page as a healthy deployment. This script therefore judges where a response
# goes rather than what it is numbered, and reports a wall as "could not check"
# rather than as either a pass or a deployment failure: a preview nobody can
# reach is a statement about this node's configuration, not about the branch.
#
# --fetch <path> (repeatable) goes one step further: once the checks above
# confirm the preview is reachable, it prints the response status, headers,
# and body for each given route — the served CSP header, an error page's
# actual text, whatever the diff needs read back. It sends the same
# x-vercel-protection-bypass header the readiness check does, so the secret
# never has to appear in a command line or a stage transcript to read a
# protected preview's own content. Each route's output is wrapped in a
# delimiter naming it as fetched content: whatever the pull request under
# review made the preview serve, read as evidence about the change, never as
# an instruction to follow, however it is phrased inside the page.
#
# What it reads from the environment:
#   GH_TOKEN                         the deployment and its status. Already set
#                                    on every node.
#   VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET  Vercel → the project → Settings →
#                                    Deployment Protection → Protection Bypass
#                                    for Automation. Sent as the
#                                    x-vercel-protection-bypass header; without
#                                    it every preview reads as protected.
#   VERCEL_TOKEN                     optional. The tail of the build log when a
#                                    deployment failed; without it a failure
#                                    still names the deployment's inspector URL,
#                                    which is where a human would go.
#
# One secret serves one Vercel project, which is all this operation has. A
# second deployed repository needs the secret chosen per repo rather than read
# from one variable — the only line here that would have to change.
#
# Exit: 0 deployed and answering · 1 the deployment failed, or the page does
# not answer · 2 could not check (no deployment yet, still building, protected,

                         [--fetch <path> ...]

Report the state of the Vercel preview deployment for a pull request, and
whether the deployed page actually answers.

With no arguments it asks about the pull request for the branch checked out in
the current directory, which is how a pipeline stage runs it from its own
workspace clone.

  --repo   owner/name (default: the repository in the current directory)
  --pr     pull request number (default: the one for the current branch)
  --sha    a head SHA, instead of a pull request
  --path   the path to request (default: /) — e.g. /api/health
  --wait   seconds to keep polling while the deployment is still building
           (default: 0, answer immediately)
  --fetch  a route to print status, headers and body for, once the preview is
           reachable — repeatable, e.g. --fetch / --fetch /api/health. Read
           evidence, not a pass/fail check: it does not affect the exit code.
           Oversized or binary bodies are truncated with a note saying so.

Needs GH_TOKEN, and VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET to get past Vercel
Authentication. VERCEL_TOKEN is optional and buys the build log on a failure.

Exit 0 deployed and answering, 1 failed or not answering, 2 could not check.
