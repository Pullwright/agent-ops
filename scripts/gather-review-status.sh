# gather-review-status.sh — whether a project-review recommendation's own ref
# is named by a merged pull request on the default branch (requirement 34i's
# project-review half).
#
# Given a repo slug, its default branch and one or more recommendation refs
# (`review-<date>-R-NN`), print a JSON object mapping each ref it could confirm
# a merged pull request against to `"merged"`:
#
#   {"review-2026-07-11-R-02": "merged"}
#
# Usage: gather-review-status.sh <owner/repo> <default-branch> <ref> [<ref>…]
#
# ## The same test requirement 16 already applies
#
# A `project-review` recommendation is already excluded from the Co-Ordinator's
# candidates once "a *merged* pull request references its ref"
# (`docs/spec/implementation/requirements`, requirement 16) — the review folder
# itself is a point-in-time record and is never edited to say a recommendation
# is done (requirement 25), so a merged PR naming the ref, put there by the
# Implementer that closed it out (the Implementer prompt's `source: project-review`
# section), is the only fact anywhere that can answer "is this one finished?".
# This reads that same fact, so a block can clear on it without paying for a
# Co-Ordinator to notice.
#
# ## Only the refs asked for, and only when they are blocked
#
# Like `gather-register-status.sh`, this answers one question about a handful
# of named items and the Script calls it only for the blocked items whose refs
# are project-review refs, which is nearly always none. A fleet with no blocked
# project-review items spends nothing here.
#
# ## Sampled, not exhaustive
#
# The search is the repo's 100 most-recently-closed pull requests, the same
# page size every gatherer uses. A recommendation closed by a PR that has since
# aged off that page answers nothing here — the safe direction, since the block
# then simply waits for the Enabler exactly as it always did.
#
# Never exits non-zero: it always prints a valid object. A gatherer that
# aborted the cycle would make a tidy-up a reliability risk.
