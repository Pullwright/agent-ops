# gather-unvoid-requests.sh — pre-fetch the voids a human has asked, on GitHub,
# to be reopened (requirement 34f).
#
# Given a repo slug, print a JSON array of unvoid requests: the issues and pull
# requests in that repo carrying <label>, each resolved to the item ids it names
# and the moment the label was applied.
#
# Usage: gather-unvoid-requests.sh <owner/repo> [label]
#
# Request shape:
#   {
#     "repo": "Poetic-Poems/poetic",
#     "number": 92,
#     "url": "https://github.com/…/pull/92",
#     "kind": "pr",                          // or "issue"
#     "labelled_at": "2026-07-25T21:40:28Z", // when the label was applied
#     "items": ["TD26072114"]                // every item id the thing names
#   }
#
# ## Why this source exists
#
# Requirement 34c is emphatic that only a human may clear a void, and gives no
# agent a way to do it. That is the right rule, and it has one practical hole:
# the interface it leaves the human is a line appended by hand to
# `state_dir/log.jsonl`, and the human is not where that file is. The nodes are
# containers; `state_dir` is a Docker volume inside one. A maintainer who wants
# to reopen an item is holding a browser, looking at the pull request the void
# is about.
#
# So the escape hatch the whole design depends on was, in practice, out of
# reach — and the failure was silent in the worst way. Faced with a void on
# `TD26072114`, the maintainer did the obvious, discoverable thing and applied a
# label called `unvoided` to PR #92. Nothing read it. The item stayed void, the
# fleet went on standing down hourly, and the label sat there looking like the
# action had been taken. That instinct was not wrong, either: labelling a PR
# `autonomous-agent` already hands it to this pipeline, so a label *is* the
# established way to tell this system something from GitHub.
#
# This does not weaken requirement 34c. Only a human can apply the label — the
# Landing Gate reserves that, and no stage here labels anything with it — so
# "only a human may clear a void" holds exactly as before. What changes is
# where the human has to be standing.
#
# ## The requests are not the decision
#
# This script reports what carries the label; `lib/unvoid-label.sh` decides
# which of those actually clear anything, and it is deliberately narrow: a
# request clears a void only if that item is void *now* and the void was
# recorded *before* the label went on. Two properties follow, and both matter
# more than they look:
#
#   - **It is idempotent without touching the label.** A void already cleared is
#     not cleared again, so nothing needs removing and no cycle logs a duplicate.
#     That is why the label is never removed here: a self-limiting rule needs no
#     cleanup, and label edits are this system writing to its own bookkeeping
#     surface — the abandoned-drafts source discounts them for exactly that
#     reason (requirement 3e), so the only thing removal could achieve is churn
#     on the pull request a human is trying to unstick.
#   - **A label left behind cannot become a standing gag-removal.** A void
#     recorded *after* the label was applied is a fresh verdict the label never
#     saw, and it stands. Without that test an old label would silently
#     auto-clear every future void on the same item, which is a worse failure
#     than the one this fixes: it would look like nothing at all.
#
# ## The item ids
#
# Resolved the same way the other gatherers resolve theirs — `grep -oiE` over the
# branch name, title and body — so a label on the PR that is *about* an item
# reaches that item without the human having to know the register's spelling.
# An issue additionally names itself: its own number is an item id in this
# system (the `issues` source), and a human labelling an issue means that issue.
#
# All the ids found are reported, not just the first: a pull request may
# legitimately name two, and reporting one arbitrarily would work until the day
# it picked the wrong one. Over-reporting is bounded by the decision rule above
# — an id that is not void clears nothing — so the cost of a spurious id is nil
# and the cost of a missing one is the silence this source exists to end.
#
# Fails safe: always prints a valid JSON array and exits 0. A repo with no
# labelled issues contributes `[]`; an API that will not answer contributes `[]`
# too, and the request is seen next cycle instead.
