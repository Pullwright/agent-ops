# doctor.sh — check an installation end to end, before it runs a cycle.
#
# Everything this system needs to work sits in three places: the
# configuration, the toolchain around it, and the GitHub access it is granted.
# Each fails differently and none of them fails clearly. A misconfigured key is
# silent by construction — an unread key is a default nobody chose; a missing
# tool surfaces an hour later as a stage that died mid-cycle, after the work
# was already claimed; a token missing a scope shows up as an empty work
# source, which looks exactly like a repository with no work in it. The checks
# below are chosen for that: each one is a failure that otherwise costs a
# cycle, or a night, to notice.
#
# Read-only, with two exceptions it declares: it creates the state and
# workspace directories the configuration already names, because being able to
# create them is the thing being checked, and it renders a trial crontab into
# a `mktemp -d` it removes afterwards, to prove the template and the schedule
# in the config actually produce one. Every GitHub call is a GET. Safe to run
# against a live node at any time, including while a cycle holds the lock.
#
# Three verdicts, and a fourth for what it could not reach:
#
#   fail — the pipeline will not work, or will work on something other than
#          what the configuration says. Exit status 1.
#   warn — it will work, but something here will surprise the operator later.
#   skip — the check needs something unavailable right now (the network, an
#          authenticated `gh`, a usable `claude` credential), so it is
#          neither passed nor failed.
#
# Run it after editing config.json, on a new node before its first cycle, and
# whenever a cycle does something the configuration does not explain:
#
#   scripts/doctor.sh                 # this installation
#   scripts/doctor.sh --offline       # everything but GitHub access and the two Claude checks
#   scripts/doctor.sh --unattended    # the full GitHub section, none of the model spend
#   scripts/doctor.sh --config PATH   # a config not yet deployed
#
# --unattended is what deploy/docker/crontab.tmpl's own hourly line runs,
# unprompted: the GitHub section (issue_priority_options_complete above all —
# agent-ops#543) is the one place configuration drift shows up only against a
# live repository, so an operator who never happens to run this by hand would
# otherwise never see it. Skips only the two checks --offline also skips for
# being network-gated, but for a different reason (see usage()); the GitHub
# section itself stays in full, since every call there is a GET. When it
# reaches the end of a run it writes state_dir/.doctor-status.json for
# scripts/publish-dashboard.sh to surface — the one write this mode adds to
# the "read-only, with two exceptions" rule above.
#
# Exit: 0 clean (warnings and skips included) · 1 at least one failure ·
#       2 the arguments or the config file itself were unusable.

usage: doctor.sh [--config PATH] [--offline] [--unattended] [--quiet]

Check this installation end to end: the configuration against
config.schema.json, the toolchain the pipelines need, the directories they
write to, the rendered crontab, the GitHub access they are granted, the
Claude credentials the stages run as, and whether a stage's event stream
really flushes as it runs on this node.

  --config PATH  Check this file instead of the repository's config.json.
  --offline      Skip every check that needs the network (GitHub access, the
                 Claude credentials, the stream-flushing probe); report them
                 skipped. The probe is the one check here that spends: a
                 single call to the cheapest configured model.
  --unattended   For a scheduled, unprompted pass (deploy/docker/crontab.tmpl's
                 hourly line): run the Configuration section and the whole
                 GitHub section — every call there is a GET, so none of it
                 costs anything a schedule shouldn't spend — but skip the two
                 checks that do spend: the Claude-credentials check and the
                 stream-flushing probe (a model call). Each is reported
                 skipped with its own reason, distinct from --offline's.
                 Also writes state_dir/.doctor-status.json, which
                 scripts/publish-dashboard.sh reads to surface this run's
                 warnings and failures. --offline already implies these two
                 skips; combining the flags adds nothing.
  --quiet        Print only warnings, failures and the summary.

Exit 0 clean, 1 at least one failure, 2 unusable arguments or config.

  #
  # One helper for every repository's write-access verdict — target, review
  # and state_repo alike — so the three call sites cannot drift apart on what
  # counts as ok/fail/skip, the way a hand-rolled state_repo check once did:
  # its own `push == false || push == null` collapsed both into `fail`,
  # reporting a token that merely can't be asked as one that can't push.
  #
  # **`.permissions` answers for a PAT and only for a PAT** (agent-ops#1397).
  # Asked with a forge authoring App installation token, GitHub returns the
  # object present but every member false —
  # `{"admin":false,"maintain":false,"pull":false,"push":false,"triage":false}`
  # — whatever that installation was actually granted. `pull: false` on a read
  # that has just succeeded is what gives it away: the field is not a report
  # on this token at all. Since the Author App went live (#1396) the seam
  # leaves `GH_TOKEN` empty in PID 1's environment, so every cron child's `gh`
  # mints through the App and every repository read `push == false` — which
  # this check turned into seven `fail`s per node on all four nodes at once,
  # against a token that was pushing pull requests the whole time. That
  # fleet-wide uniformity is the #1071 signature, and it was the reader.
  #
  # So the question is asked of whichever source can answer it for the
  # identity the transport will actually present:
  #
  #   - **PAT** (`GH_TOKEN` set, or no App configured): `.permissions.push`,
  #     exactly as before. A fine-grained PAT really does split read from
  #     write this way, and this is still the only place that shows it.
  #   - **App**: the installation's own record — `contents: write` (what it
  #     may do) *and* the repository selection covering this slug (where it
  #     may do it). Both are owner acts, invisible to config.json, and a
  #     `selected` installation that leaves a configured repository out is a
  #     genuine "claims work here and loses it at push" this must still fail.
  #
  # `archived` is read from the same response for both paths: that one is a
  # fact about the repository, which the App token reads perfectly well.

  # re-scoped through GitHub's own consent screen at any time, entirely
  # outside config.json. Exactly three permissions are needed, no more and no
  # less: contents:write (push a review's own comments and, at
  # agent-merges-routine+, land), metadata:read (read the repository at all)
  # and pull_requests:write (submit the review).

  # One App may hold several installations, one per repository owner

  # via lib/approver-token.sh's approver_token_installation_id_for, from
  # PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_IDS falling back to
  # PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_INSTALLATION_ID) — so both reads happen once per
  # *distinct installation id*, not once fleet-wide: two owners sharing one
  # installation cost one read each, not two, and an owner with neither
  # variable naming it is a `fail` right here, naming the owner and both
  # variables, rather than a silent skip. The loop runs from `agent-approves`
  # upward (agent-ops#1060): a repository at `human` is skipped before its
  # owner is even resolved, the same convention the readiness verdict below
  # already follows. Gated the same way the runtime-credential check above is

# and the evidence for this design was gathered on one machine and one CLI
# version, so another may differ — the file stays empty until the run ends and
# the watchdog kills every healthy stage at its threshold. There is no partial
# version of that failure: streaming either works on this node or the pipeline
# stops working on this node. So it is checked here, on this node, with a real
# invocation, rather than reasoned about.
#
# The cost is one call to the cheapest configured model with a one-word
# prompt — the same spend requirement 1b's usage-limit probe makes, for the
# same reason: some questions can only be answered by asking. `doctor.sh` is
