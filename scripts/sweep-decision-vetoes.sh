# scripts/sweep-decision-vetoes.sh — find a `pw::decision` decision-log issue
# a human reopened (a veto, agent-ops#937) and act on it, for one repository.
#
# `decide-tactical` (agent-ops#936) lets the pipeline take a tactical decision
# on its own authority rather than paging a human. `lib/enabler.sh`'s `decide`
# verdict files the decision's own durable record as a closed `pw::decision`
# issue (`create_decision_log_issue`) — a log, not an ask. Reopening that
# issue is the veto this sweep watches for: the human's one-click way to undo
# a decision after the fact, the D18 pattern (a log a human can scan, a lever
# they can pull) applied to decisions the way requirement 36a already applies
# it to escalations.
#
# For each `pw::decision` issue this repository carries that is open, carries a
# `reopened` event (an open issue that was never closed is one whose own filing
# could not close it, not a veto — see the check itself below), and that this
# sweep has not already processed (the caller pre-filters stdin against
# `decision_vetoes_processed_items`, lib/cycle-state.sh — the `decision-vetoed`
# events already on the log, keyed on the log issue's own number so a later
# decision under a fresh log issue is never mistaken for one already
# answered):
#
#   - the original item is not terminal (still open, or its implementing pull
#     request is still open): a `needs-refinement` action is reported (the
#     caller records the block — `record_needs_refinement_block` reads and
#     writes cycle globals no standalone script has), a comment is posted on
#     the item's own thread (issue-shaped items only) naming the veto and the
#     log issue, and any open pull request for the item is commented on and
#     flipped back to draft;
#   - the original item is terminal (merged or closed): a fresh
#     "revisit: <decision title>" issue is filed, labelled `bug`, quoting the
#     log issue's own veto comment, and the log issue itself gets one comment
#     saying so.
#
# Either way, one `vetoed` action is always reported first — this is what the
# caller logs `decision-vetoed` from, and what future calls' own exclusion set
# is built from.
#
# The original item's repo/ref are read from the log issue body's own
# machine marker (`enabler_decision_log_body`, lib/enabler.sh):
#   <!-- agent-ops:decision-log item=<item> repo=<repo> reason_key=<key> -->
# (`reason_key` is optional in the match below — a log issue filed before
# agent-ops#1198's review-round-2 fix carries the marker without it, and this
# sweep only ever needs `item`/`repo` from it). A log issue missing the
# marker entirely is not one this pipeline filed — reported as a warning,
# left alone.
#
# Output: one JSON object per action on stdout —
#   {"action":"vetoed","repo":…,"item":…,"issue_number":…,"issue_url":…,"by":…,"terminal":true|false}
#   {"action":"needs-refinement","repo":…,"item":…,"reason":…,"missing":…,"evidence":…}

# Stdin: a JSON array of this repo's already-processed vetoes, the shape
#   `decision_vetoes_processed_items` (lib/cycle-state.sh) produces, filtered

#   `item` is the *log issue's own number*, not the original work item's ref.
