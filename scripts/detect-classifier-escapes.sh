# scripts/detect-classifier-escapes.sh — independent post-hoc classifier-
# escape detector (D18 Stage 2 exit criterion "zero classifier escapes",
# agent-ops#572).
#
# `lib/landing.sh`'s `landing_eligible` is the *decision*: given a pull
# request's complexity, source and the effective `merge_autonomy` level,
# does it qualify for automatic landing? Nothing independently re-checks the
# *outcome* — that every pull request which actually landed autonomously was
# in fact eligible. This script is that check, and by design it never calls
# `landing_eligible`, and never sources `lib/landing.sh` at all: the
# protected-path list and the "did this land under the Approver identity"
# test below are each reimplemented from scratch, deliberately, per the
# issue's own Refiner comment ("`landing_protected_paths` and the
# Approver-identity check already exist in lib/landing.sh — read there for
# the exact logic this detector must reproduce independently (not call
# into)"). An audit that shared the code it exists to check could not catch
# a bug in that shared code — both the classifier and its own auditor would
# agree, and agreement is exactly what a classifier escape looks like from
# the inside. `test/detect-classifier-escapes.test.sh` pins the reimplemented
# protected-path list identical to `lib/landing.sh`'s own, so the two cannot
# drift apart unnoticed even though neither sources the other.
#
# ## What counts as "landed under the Approver identity"
#
# Not "carries `pr_label`", and not "has a `landing-armed` event in the fleet
# log" — trusting the pipeline's own event log to say which pull requests it
# landed would make the audit circular, exactly the thing it exists to avoid
# (a bug that caused `agent-cycle.sh` to log `landing-armed` without actually
# arming, or against the wrong pull request, would then audit nothing wrong).
# Instead: every merged, `pr_label`-carrying pull request in SLUG whose own
# `merged_by.login` (GitHub's live record, `gh api repos/SLUG/pulls/N`) is
# APPROVER_LOGIN. `landing_arm` (lib/landing.sh) always writes under the
# Approver App's minted token, never a human's, so this is the fact of an
# autonomous landing exactly as GitHub itself recorded it — independent of
# whether this pipeline's own log agrees.
#
# ## What is recomputed, and from what
#
#   - **Protected-path hit** — from the *merge commit's own file list*
#     (`gh api repos/SLUG/commits/SHA`), never the pull request's changed-file
#     endpoint `landing_protected_paths_hit` reads: a different GitHub
#     resource entirely, so a bug specific to either read is caught by the
#     other disagreeing. Checked against SLUG's own `merge_autonomy_protected_paths`
#     (repo override, else the top-level key, else the shipped default),
#     resolved fresh from CONFIG_FILE by a copy of the matching logic
#     `lib/landing.sh`'s own `_landing_protected_paths`/`_landing_is_protected`
#     use, declared here rather than sourced (see above) — the same
#     "necessarily read from *current* configuration" caveat the
#     routine-sources list below already carries applies here too. `landing_eligible`
#     (`lib/landing.sh`) is level-
#     dependent here, and this recomputation must be too: below
#     `agent-merges-all` a hit refuses unconditionally, so this detector
#     treats it as a disagreement there exactly as before; at
#     `agent-merges-all` `landing_eligible` itself reports `eligible` and
#     defers to the D18 WI-12 compensating controls
#     (`landing_protected_path_controls_ok`) gate 4.5 of the arming step
#     (requirement 8d) actually checks — facts (the approving tier, the
#     standing review's own `submitted_at`/`commit_id`) this post-hoc
#     detector has no way to recompute. Recording that case as a
#     disagreement would manufacture a first-class `escape` out of every
#     sanctioned `agent-merges-all` protected-path landing, so it is treated
#     as an unreconstructable input instead: it can only ever push the
#     outcome to `unverifiable`, never `escape` and never `clean`.
#   - **Complexity** — not the `complexity:*` label GitHub shows *today*
#     (labels change), but whichever one the pull request actually carried
#     *at the moment it merged*, replayed from its own labelled/unlabelled
#     timeline (`gh api repos/SLUG/issues/N/events`) up to `merged_at`. A
#     landing audited weeks later still reports the complexity it actually
#     landed at.
#   - **Source** — GitHub carries no field for this at all (`lib/landing.sh`'s
#     own `landing_retry_source` header explains why), so it is read back
#     from the one place it is genuinely recorded: the fleet log's own
#     `landing-armed` event for this `pr_url`, which itself only ever holds
#     the value the round that armed the landing was given — never a value
#     `landing_eligible` derived. The same event is the carrier for the
#     effective level below, and for the same reason; note that neither
#     read-back makes the audit circular, because the log never decides *what
#     gets audited* — the candidate set comes from GitHub's own `merged_by`
#     (above) — and neither field is a verdict `landing_eligible` reached,
#     only an input it was handed.
#   - **The `merge_autonomy` level** — the *effective* level the landing was
#     actually armed under, read back from the same `landing-armed` event the
#     source comes from: `agent-cycle.sh`'s arming step records it there at
#     the moment gate 1 resolves it, kill switch and per-repo merge-budget
#     freeze already folded in. Never SLUG's configured level as it stands
#     today. This script runs post hoc with no state-repo access, so today's
#     `config.json` cannot tell it what was in force at a past merge: an
#     operator's later dial-down of the key — the exact move D18 staging
#     makes, and the direction an incident would move it — would manufacture
#     a first-class `escape` out of a landing that was correct when it
#     happened, driving the Stage 2 "zero classifier escapes" exit criterion
#     non-zero on an action with nothing wrong with it, while in the other
#     direction a since-cleared kill switch or since-lifted freeze would read
#     a level that actually forbade landing as one that permitted it. A
#     recorded level below `agent-merges-routine` is therefore an
#     authoritative gate-1 failure rather than an artefact of when the sweep
#     happened to arrive; a `landing-armed` event carrying no level at all
#     (armed before the field existed) reports `unverifiable`, exactly as a
#     missing source already does — never `clean`, and never `escape`.
#   - **The routine-sources list** — SLUG's own `merge_autonomy_routine_sources`
#     (repo override, else the top-level key, else the shipped default),
#     resolved fresh from CONFIG_FILE by a copy of the precedence
#     `lib/landing.sh`'s own `_landing_routine_sources` uses, declared here
#     rather than sourced, for the same reason as the protected-path list.
#     This is necessarily read from *current* configuration, not whatever was
#     in force the moment a given pull request landed — nothing in this
#     codebase preserves that history — so a landing audited long after a
#     deliberate widening or narrowing of this key is judged by today's list.
#     That is a real, accepted limitation of a post-hoc audit over a
#     forward-only log, not an oversight.
#   - **The routine-complexity list** — SLUG's own
#     `merge_autonomy_routine_complexity` (D18 Stage 3, agent-ops#725; repo
#     override, else the top-level key, else the shipped default `["low",
#     "medium"]`), resolved fresh from CONFIG_FILE by a copy of the
#     precedence `lib/landing.sh`'s own `_landing_routine_complexity` uses,
#     declared here rather than sourced, for the same reason as the
#     routine-sources list above — and with the same current-configuration
#     limitation: a landing audited long after this key was deliberately
#     widened or narrowed is judged by today's list, not the one in force
#     when it landed.
#
# Any input that cannot be reconstructed reports `unverifiable`, never
# `clean` — an unreadable merge commit's file list, a merge with zero or
# more than one `complexity:*` label standing at merge time, or a pull
# request with no matching `landing-armed` event to read a source from, or
# one whose `landing-armed` event records no effective level. A protected-
# path hit recorded at `agent-merges-all` is the same shape: `landing_eligible`
# defers that case to compensating controls this detector cannot recompute
# post hoc, so it reports `unverifiable` there too, never `escape` — unless
# some other, genuinely reconstructable input already disagrees on its own
# (a level below `agent-merges-routine`, a complexity outside the routine
# complexity list, a source outside the routine list), in which case that
# disagreement alone is enough to call it an `escape` regardless. An
# `unverifiable` landing is exactly as far from "cleared" as an `escape` is:
# neither is silently folded into the other.
#
# ## Idempotency
#
# Each merged, `pr_label`-carrying pull request this candidate list can name
# is looked up at most once, ever, regardless of who merged it: LOG_FILE
# (the fleet's own union log, or stdin/"-") is scanned first for every prior
# `classifier-escape`/`landing-audit`/`landing-audit-skip` event's own
# `pr_url`, and every candidate number is checked against that set *before*
# the `repos/SLUG/pulls/N` read that would otherwise be the only way to
# learn its own `pr_url` — GitHub's `html_url` for a pull request is always
# `https://github.com/SLUG/pull/N`, so an already-seen candidate is
# recognised, and skipped, at zero further `gh` cost. A pull request's own
# merged history is a fixed, past fact, so nothing about re-checking it
# later could change the answer.
#
# A candidate merged by anyone other than the Approver identity is not
# *audited* — there is nothing for this detector to recompute against a
# merge nothing in this pipeline armed — but the `repos/SLUG/pulls/N` read
# that established that fact is recorded too, once, as its own
# `outcome: "not-approver"` line (`agent-cycle.sh` logs it as a distinct
# `landing-audit-skip` event, kept out of `counts.escape_audits` — see
# "Output" below — since it is not a landing audit finding). That read is
# therefore paid exactly once per pull request, the same as an audited one,
# never again on a later cycle: the fact of who merged something is as fixed
# as the fact of whether recomputed eligibility agreed with it.
# `_escape_audit_candidates` lists oldest-created first for this reason
# (GitHub's own `sort=created&direction=asc` — creation order, which is not
# quite merge order: a long-lived pull request merges after a younger one
# and still sorts ahead of it): whatever a single `timeout 120` budget
# reaches, it reaches starting from the oldest still-unrecorded history
# rather than an ever-shifting newest slice, so the ground a cycle covers
# stays covered instead of being displaced by newer merges landing ahead of
# it, and — because every candidate this reaches becomes free to skip from
# the very next cycle onward, whichever of the two facts it turned out to
# carry — a cycle's budget goes further than the last cycle's until the
# whole backlog is recorded, rather than being pinned at a permanent
# frontier. Measured against Poetic-Poems/agent-ops on 2026-08-22, before
# this backlog was ever recorded: 190 merged `pr_label`-carrying pull
# requests, none of them merged by the Approver identity, at ~0.9 s per
# `repos/SLUG/pulls/N` read — about 170 s to record all of them once against
# a 120 s budget, so paying down that one-time backlog itself spans more
# than a single cycle. What `counts.escape_audits` reports is therefore a
# floor on what has been checked at any given moment, but, unlike before
# this fix, one that converges on complete coverage as the backlog is paid
# down rather than one permanently short of it.
#
# ## Output
#
# One compact JSON object per newly-recorded pull request, printed to
# stdout — never appended to the fleet log directly. Requirement 33 reserves
# that single-writer act to `agent-cycle.sh`, under its own lock
# (agents/scripts report; the Script translates into events) — this script
# is invoked from there, once per repository per cycle, and never runs
# standalone against the live log for that reason, exactly the same shape
# `scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh` already established. Each line:
#
#   {"outcome": "clean"|"escape"|"unverifiable"|"not-approver", "pr_url": "...",
#    "repo": "OWNER/REPO", "number": 123, "merge_commit_sha": "..."|null,
#    "source": "..."|null, "complexity_recomputed": "low"|"medium"|"high"|null,
#    "protected_paths_hit": true|false|null, "protected_paths": [...]|null,
#    "reason": "..."}
#
# `reason` is always present: for `clean` it says so plainly; for `escape` it
# names which check disagreed; for `unverifiable` it names which input could
# not be reconstructed; for `not-approver` it names who merged it instead. The
# first three are audit findings — `agent-cycle.sh` logs them as
# `classifier-escape` (escape) or `landing-audit` (clean/unverifiable), and
# `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh` folds exactly those two event names into
# `counts.escape_audits`. `not-approver` is not an audit finding — nothing
# armed this merge, so there is no eligibility to have recomputed —
# `agent-cycle.sh` logs it instead as `landing-audit-skip`, a durable record
# of "already looked at, nothing to audit" that `counts.escape_audits`
# deliberately never folds in, kept apart for exactly that reason.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/detect-classifier-escapes.sh SLUG APPROVER_LOGIN LOG_FILE

# config.json beside this script; with no --label, reads config.json's
# `pr_label` (default "autonomous-agent"), matching every other script that
# scopes a GitHub read to this pipeline's own pull requests.
#
# Environment:

# the sweep again — `timeout 120` silently stops bounding anything and the
# run costs whatever the whole candidate list costs. Exiting through `exit`
# with the signal's own 128+n, the shape `agent-cycle.sh`'s `on_signal` uses,
# both keeps the bound real and still lets every line already emitted reach
# the caller, since this script reports by printing as it goes.
