# cron can't fire more than once a minute, so cron launches this once every
# 5 minutes and it self-loops for ~295s (leaving a ~5s gap so consecutive cron
# runs don't overlap). Each tick regenerates the dashboard; a full
# GitHub-hitting refresh runs only when the last one has aged out (~5 minutes),
# with the cheap local-only --no-github refresh in between — so the page stays
# near-live without hammering the GitHub API.
#
# A tick lands on a 5-second boundary as before, but the loop also measures
# what each tick costs and idles a multiple of that before the next one, so the
# Publisher can never take more than a fixed share of the window whatever a
# publish grows to cost. See `duty_divisor` below.

# The loop used to sleep to the next 5-second boundary and no more, whatever a
# tick had just cost, on the assumption a tick fits in five seconds (the
# `tick_margin` note above, and this file's header). Nothing measured a tick,
# so nothing noticed when that stopped being true: by 2026-08-25 a publish cost
# 20-22s on every node, and the window ran rebuilds back to back — ~11 per
# window, roughly 78% of a core, measured at 4 rebuilds per 120s on `poetic-1`
# (#799). The page it produced was byte-identical each time on an idle node.
#
# Pacing off the measured cost rather than a constant is what makes this
# self-correcting: a cheap tick earns a cheap backoff and the page stays as
# live as it ever was (a 0.4s no-op tick still lands on the next 5-second
# boundary), while an expensive one pays for itself. It needs no per-node
# tuning and cannot be invalidated by the state growing, which a hard-coded
# budget — or a hand-set LAUNCHER_WINDOW — can and did.

# lines, between two intact ones, left by a watchtower roll back when a roll
# could still land mid-cycle. Rolls now defer to a running cycle
# (deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh), but every other unclean stop still
# does this: a manual `up -d` or `down`, a host reboot, an OOM kill.
#
# The lost lines are lost. What matters is what the hole does to every *later*
# read: one NUL anywhere makes the whole file binary, and grep then stops
# printing matches for all 8 MB of plain text around it. GNU grep at least says
# "binary file matches"; ugrep, which is what `grep` resolves to on the node
# owner's own shell, prints nothing and exits 1 — indistinguishable from "the
# heartbeat has never logged a refresh". That is precisely the wrong failure
# for the one file you open when something is wrong, and it persists for the
# life of the log.
#
# So strip the NULs once per window and record what was dropped, rather than
# closing the gap silently — the loss is a fact about the node worth keeping
# (`fleet_repair_log`, lib/fleet.sh). It hits the same hazard in `log.jsonl`,
# `review-log.jsonl` and `revert-rate.jsonl` too, so repair those the same way
# each window, alongside `dashboard.log`.
#
# Except `log.jsonl` while the implementation cycle holds its lock. A running
# cycle copies its own new events into its union snapshot by line number —
# `tail -n "+$(( log_lines_before + 1 ))"`, with `log_lines_before` taken from
# `wc -l` (lib/candidate-gather.sh, lib/standdown.sh) — and a repair that
# drops K damaged lines and appends one record of its own moves every later
# line up by K-1, so the snapshot would silently lose that many of the cycle's
# events. The size check in `fleet_repair_swap` does not catch it, because no
# append needs to overlap the repair. The lock is live by `acquire_lock`'s own
# test (agent-cycle.sh): a pid that `kill -0` finds, in a lock that names this
# container or names none. The launcher and the cycle share a container, so a
# lock naming another one is a dead container's, which the next cycle takes
# over. Nothing takes line offsets into the other files, and the repair is
