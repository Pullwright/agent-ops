# scripts/sweep-human-visibility.sh — the periodic, deterministic half of
# agent-ops#242 (requirement 38): for every open, ready pull request this
# system raised, make sure a human whose turn it is has actually been asked,
# and nudge one who has been waiting too long without an answer.
#
# `lib/handoff.sh`'s `confirm_review_requested` and `ensure_human_reviewer`
# already run at the moment a Reviewer or an Enabler hands a pull request off
# (agent-cycle.sh, requirement 38a) — but that only fires on the cycle that
# performs the handoff. A pull request already sitting ready from an earlier
# cycle, or one this feature did not exist for yet, gets no such check unless
# something asks again later. This script is that later ask: run once per
# cycle, fleet-wide, over every such pull request regardless of what stage (if
# any) touched it this cycle — which *is* the periodic audit agent-ops#242
# asks for, made self-healing rather than merely reported: a violation this
# script can fix (a missing review request) it fixes in the same pass, so
# there is never a gap between "detected" and "corrected" for a human to fall
# through. The one exception is a pull request idle well past the point a live
# review request alone is working (requirement 38c) — that gets a nudge
# comment as well, because the poetic-fiddle #170 case (approved, green, and
# ignored for 6.8 days) shows a live request is necessary but was not always
# sufficient.
#
# For one repository, this lists every open, non-draft pull request carrying
# `pr_label` and, for each:
#   1. Ensures a live review request exists where nothing is
#      CHANGES_REQUESTED-blocking it (`ensure_human_reviewer`) — requirement
#      38a's guarantee, kept continuously rather than only at the moment of
#      handoff — or, where the pull request's only legal candidate is its own
#      author, logs a `warning` naming that (tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26081001.md):
#      nothing else will ever ask this human, so this is the one `skip`
#      reason worth surfacing rather than passing over in silence.
#   2. Where something *is* CHANGES_REQUESTED-blocking it, the round has
#      already been answered by a marked Implementer reply, and the pull
#      request's checks are green, repeats requirement 31b's re-request
#      (`confirm_review_requested`) — the crash recovery this section
#      explains. An answered round whose checks are not green is a silent
#      no-op (agent-ops#338): the Reviewer's own `ready` verdict this call
#      stands in for carries the same green precondition (requirement 31c),
#      and re-requesting on its strength alone would ask a human to look at
#      something whose next actor is still the pipeline.
#   3. Where the pull request is approved, mergeable and green, and has been
#      since before `human_nudge_idle_hours` ago, posts one nudge comment
#      naming `enabler_assignee` — requirement 38c — unless one is there
#      already (a marker comment makes this idempotent, not time-windowed).
#      Never fires while the pull request is currently in GitHub's merge
#      queue (requirement 38f, D17): a queued pull request reads `APPROVED`/
#      `MERGEABLE`/green exactly like one nobody has acted on yet, and the
#      human has already clicked merge.
#   4. Where the pull request was recently removed from the merge queue
#      without merging, for a reason the pipeline should surface to a human
#      (a checks-failure dequeue, requirement 38f; gated on
#      `merge_queue_dequeue_actionable`, agent-ops#394 — a "manual" removal,
#      the maintainer taking their own entry back, gets no notice, since they
#      already know) — a state GitHub marks nowhere but the timeline, since a
#      dequeued pull request otherwise looks like an ordinary open one —
#      posts one notice comment naming `enabler_assignee`, unconditional on
#      `human_nudge_idle_hours` (this is new information, not the "forgot to
#      click merge" case that threshold exists for), idempotent per removal
#      event rather than per pull request, so a second dequeue gets its own
#      notice. Also bounded by `merge_queue_dequeue_notice_max_age_hours`, so
#      a removal event that predates this feature is not read as new
#      information merely because this is the first sweep to see it. `0`
#      disables the notice outright, guarded explicitly rather than left to
#      fall out of the age arithmetic (agent-ops#429).
#
# ## Why the sweep may call `confirm_review_requested`, and only narrowly
#
# `confirm_review_requested` (requirement 31b) exists for the round *after*
# the Implementer answers a review, and its ordinary call site is
# agent-cycle.sh, on the Reviewer's `ready` verdict — the one place the
# judgement "these changes answer the review" is made. If the cycle dies
# between the Implementer's push and that call, or the call itself reports
# `failed`, the pull request is left answered, green, and in nobody's review
# queue: `reviewDecision` stays `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (the author can never
# clear it) with no live request against it, and nothing before this
# self-heal existed to notice.
#
# The sweep cannot simply re-request on every `CHANGES_REQUESTED` pull
# request the way `ensure_human_reviewer` does for the unblocked case above:
# re-requesting an *unanswered* round inverts the queue (the human is asked
# to re-look at a pull request whose next actor is the pipeline), and does
# something quieter and worse — requirement 3c's candidate rule reads a
# review-requested timeline event as the round having been *answered*
# (scripts/gather-review-feedback.sh — the events-not-timestamps fix), so a
# blind re-request would drop the pull request out of the Implementer's own
# review-feedback selection while the human's `CHANGES_REQUESTED` sat
# unanswered — PR #205's silent-starvation failure, reintroduced cycle
# after cycle and fleet-wide.
#
# The discriminating judgement is `lib/handoff.sh`'s `handoff_round_answered`
# (requirement 34a, tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26080804.md): the same predicate
# requirement 3c's candidate rule uses, called here with the timeline signal
# omitted — only a marked reply from the Implementer counts as `answered`,
# never a `review_requested` event, because this call's *own* re-request
# would otherwise read back next cycle as the round having answered itself.
# `unanswered` and `unknown` (a read this script could not make) are both
# left entirely alone: only `answered` repeats the re-request.
#
# Fails safe throughout: any answer this script cannot get (a listing that
# errors, a pull request whose state cannot be read) is skipped with a
# `warning` action rather than guessed at. Two nodes sweeping the same
# repository at once is safe for the same reason lib/handoff.sh's own
# functions are: a review request or a comment either lands or it does not,
# and re-attempting a already-live one is a no-op both sides read the same way.
#
# Output: one JSON object per action on stdout —
#   {"action":"human-review-requested","pr_url":…,"reviewers":[…]}
#   {"action":"nudged","pr_url":…,"reviewer":…}
#   {"action":"dequeue-notice","pr_url":…,"reviewer":…}
#   {"action":"warning","pr_url":…,"detail":…}
# `nudged` and `dequeue-notice` are deliberately distinct actions — see
# requirement 38e and lib/human-visibility-hygiene.sh's header for why a
# posted dequeue notice must not read back as clearing an unrelated,
# still-outstanding review-request or nudge warning for the same pull
# request (agent-ops#393).
# The caller logs them; this script logs nothing itself. Exit 0 unless the
# arguments are unusable.
#   5. Where a pull request otherwise due the idle nudge above is one gate 4
#      (`lib/landing.sh`'s `_landing_stage_attempt`) most recently refused to
#      arm over an unreconciled comment or an unreadable comment-
#      reconciliation read (requirement 53, issue #979), the nudge names that
#      real reason instead of "waiting on a merge click" — the misleading text
#      every other approved/green/mergeable pull request gets, which is simply
#      false of one the pipeline is actively refusing to land over a human's
#      own comment. Read from UNION_LOG (below), the fleet-wide log —
#      `landing-refused` is a fact only this pipeline's own log carries, and
#      the refusal a peer node's own cycle logged is not visible any other
#      way — and re-confirmed live via `lib/reconciliation-gate.sh`'s
#      `reconciliation_unreconciled_comments` before the substitution is
#      trusted, the same "the logged refusal never disappears once answered"
#      reasoning `scripts/gather-landing-refusals.sh`'s own header explains:
#      once the Implementer's marked reply clears it, the stale log line must
#      not still be read as standing. Idempotent per pull request via the
#      identical `<!-- agent-ops:human-nudge -->` marker the ordinary nudge
#      already uses — this changes the nudge's wording, never how often it
#      fires.
#
# Usage: sweep-human-visibility.sh <owner/repo> [cycle-id] [node-name] [union-log]
# cycle-id and node-name stamp the nudge comment's header (requirement 9d,
# lib/pipeline-marker.sh) the same way every other pipeline-authored comment
# is stamped; both default to a placeholder a test or a manual run can ignore.
# union-log (requirement 53) is the fleet-wide union log `lib/landing.sh`'s
# `landing_latest_refusal_reason` reads; omitted or unreadable, item 5 above
# simply never fires and the nudge reads exactly as it did before this
# requirement existed.
# Environment: SWEEP_GH overrides `gh` (tests stub it); AGENT_OPS_CONFIG
