# gather-project-review.sh — deterministically pre-fetch the most recent
# repository review's recommendations, for the Refiner
# (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md, requirement 3y; TD-PPagop-26081307).
#
# Usage: gather-project-review.sh [--current-date] <owner/repo> [default-branch] [report-directory-format]
#
# ## --current-date (requirement 34n's review-superseded signal, TD-PPagop-26082309)
#
# With this flag first, the script performs only the report directory's own
# listing — never fetching `03-recommendations.md`/`04-improvement-prompts.md`
# — and prints one JSON object instead of the candidate array, then exits 0:
#
#   {"ok": true, "date": "2026-08-10"}   # a review folder was resolved
#   {"ok": true, "date": ""}             # the listing succeeded and offered
#                                         # no folder matching
#                                         # report-directory-format at all,
#                                         # including a clean 404 on that
#                                         # format's own static prefix
#   {"ok": false}                        # any other failure (API error,
#                                         # unparseable listing) — decides
#                                         # nothing
#
# This reuses the default mode's own latest-folder resolution
# (`report_directory_most_recent`) rather than a second implementation, so
# `void_review_plan_actioned` (lib/void-liveness.sh) can tell a review ref
# from a superseded folder — never re-offered by anything, since this script
# only ever reads the latest one — from one whose folder is still current.
# The default mode's own behaviour (the candidate array below) is unchanged
# by this flag's presence.
#
# report-directory-format is the repository's own resolved
# repository_review.repos[].report_directory (or repository_review.defaults',
# or the pipeline's ultimate fallback) — a GNU date(1) format string, exactly as
# review-cycle.sh resolves and passes it. Defaults to the one shared
# `REPORT_DIRECTORY_DEFAULT` (`reviews/project-review-%Y-%m-%d` — today's
# layout), so an existing caller passing only the first two arguments — or an
# empty third one — is unaffected (issue #761). Must be day-granular; see
# lib/report-directory.sh.
#
# Prints a JSON array; each entry is one candidate recommendation:
#
#   {
#     "source": "project-review",
#     "ref": "review-2026-08-10-R-03",   // the recommendation's own stable ref
#     "id": "R-03",
#     "review_date": "2026-08-10",
#     "title": "…",
#     "url": "https://github.com/…/blob/main/reviews/project-review-2026-08-10/03-recommendations.md",
#     "body": "…the whole `## R-03 — …` section of 03-recommendations.md, verbatim…",
#     "improvement_prompt": "…the fenced prompt body from 04-improvement-prompts.md, verbatim…"
#   }
#
# Sorted by recommendation number ascending — the review's own priority order.
#
# ## Deliberately narrower than gather-tech-debt.sh
#
# This does not replace the Co-Ordinator's own live read of `reviews/…`
# (prompts/coordinator.md, "Project-review recommendations"): it does not
# dedup against a mirrored tech-debt entry or issue, does not check for an
# existing open/merged pull request, and does not apply the "Large/gated"
# exclusion — all of that stays the Co-Ordinator's live judgement at
# selection time. What this hands the Refiner is just enough to write a
# specification without a second fetch: the recommendation's own detail
# section and its ready-to-run improvement prompt.
#
# ## Only the most recent review folder
#
# Report directories accumulate one per week; only the latest is ever live,
# so only it is read (same rule the Co-Ordinator's own live read already
# applies).
#
# Degrades to `[]` (exit 0) on any failure, like gather-tech-debt.sh:
# a repository with no report directory at all, or whose latest one is
# missing `03-recommendations.md`, contributes `[]` silently — a project
# without this pipeline stage yet is normal, not an error. A genuine API
# failure still prints `[]` but is loud on stderr.

# First-to-last rather than first-pair, because an improvement prompt may

# block has four fence lines in its section, not two. Closing at the first
# fence after the opening one would silently truncate such a prompt at its
# nested block, and the Refiner would write a specification from the half it
# was left with, with nothing to signal the loss. Treating the interior fence
# lines as content instead keeps the prompt whole and preserves the fences the
# author wrote; for the two-fence section the template produces, the two rules
# are identical, and for any section whose fences balance this one strictly
# adds. A section with an odd fence count is malformed either way — it renders
# wrongly on GitHub too — and this rule answers it by keeping the prompt's own
