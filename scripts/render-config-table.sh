# scripts/render-config-table.sh — render the configuration-key table rows
# that README.md, docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md and
# docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md carry, from config.schema.json.
#
# Every configuration key used to be written down three times: the README's
# table, the owning spec's table, and the schema (#195) — so a key could be
# added to the schema and forgotten in either prose copy (#198). This script
# makes the schema the single source: each leaf key's `x-docs.readme` and
# `x-docs.spec` are the two documents' own prose (they are not
# interchangeable — the spec's cites requirement numbers and test-only env
# overrides, the README's cites README anchors and is addressed to someone
# installing), and `x-docs.value` — when present — is the verbatim value
# cell. `x-docs.value` is either one string for both documents, or an object
# keyed `readme`/`spec` for the keys whose two tables say different things
# there (the spec's `Value` column carries the unit — `4 h`, `15 min` — that
# the README's `Default` column leaves to the key's name and its notes), and
# an audience absent from that object falls through as if the key had no
# `x-docs.value` at all. Falling through renders the schema `default` — a
# non-empty string bare in backticks, so a label reads `unvoided` rather than
# `"unvoided"` beside the two dozen rows whose value comes from
# `x-docs.value`; anything else as compact JSON in backticks — and a key with
# no `default` either renders `*(required)*`. A key entirely absent from
# `x-docs` falls back to its plain `description`.
#
# A bare-string `x-docs.value` carries a second meaning besides the cell text:
# whether it equals this key's own schema `default` says which installation it
# describes. Equal, it documents the product's shipped behaviour — the value
# every fresh install gets, not a claim about any config.json — and nothing
# checks a live installation against it. Differing, it documents Poetic's own
# choice for this key, and `scripts/doctor.sh` (`lib/config-schema.sh`'s
# `config_documented_value_mismatches`) warns if a live config.json ever
# resolves that key to something else — `refiner_model` documented as
# `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` while the key had never once been set, silently
# running the stage off, was exactly this drift with nothing to catch it
# (issue #567). That check compares parsed values, not this script's rendered
# text, so a documented `["a", "b"]` and a live `["a","b"]` compare equal
# despite the whitespace this script's own compact-JSON rendering never
# produces; an `x-docs.value` keyed `readme`/`spec` (the two documents assert
# different things there) or a key with no `default` to differ from is outside
# what that single-value comparison can state, and is skipped.
#
# `x-docs.readme`/`x-docs.spec` (a key's notes, not its value) is a plain
# string, or an array of *blocks* (#220): a plain string element is its own
# paragraph; `{"list": [...]}` is an unordered list, each item a string; and
# `{"code": "...", "lang": "..."}` (`lang` optional) is a fenced code example.
# Two renderings of the same blocks exist because a table cell and a
# generated `### Extended notes` subsection (below) can hold different
# things: a cell is one line, so every block flattens into it — a paragraph
# verbatim, a list's items joined `, `, code's newlines turned to spaces and
# wrapped in a backtick span — with a single space between blocks, the same
# join a plain array of paragraph strings always got; the Extended notes
# subsection is ordinary document prose, so blocks render as real block
# Markdown there instead — a blank line between paragraphs, a real `- `
# list, a real fenced ```` ``` ```` block — one blank line between each pair
# of blocks. A plain string (no array) is exactly a one-block array, in
# either rendering, which is why every existing single-string and
# single-paragraph-array note renders unchanged.
#
# Row order is the schema's own property order (`jq`'s `keys_unsorted`), so
# reordering a table means reordering the schema. `schedule` and
# `repository_review` are the two top-level object-valued properties whose own
# children are rendered instead of themselves, one level deep, as dotted keys
# (`schedule.review_hour`, `repository_review.lock_stale_after`) in the parent's
# position; `repository_review.defaults` nests one level deeper still, so its own
# children render as `repository_review.defaults.model` and so on, on the same
# principle. Everything else (`repos`, `repository_review.repos`,
# `prompt_overrides`) renders as a single row.
#
# Four marked regions hold the whole table — header row, `|---|---|---|`
# delimiter row, then the generated body rows:
#
#   README.md                              id=main, id=review
#   docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md   id=main
#   docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md           id=review
#
#   <!-- config-table:start id=main -->
#   | Key | Default | Notes |
#   |---|---|---|
#   ...generated rows...
#   <!-- config-table:end -->
#
# The header and delimiter — the region's first two lines — are preserved
# verbatim rather than generated, which is what lets the README say `Default`
# and the specs say `Value` without this script knowing either. They live
# *inside* the markers rather than above the start marker: a bare HTML
# comment line between the delimiter row and the first data row has no pipe
# in it, so it does not look like a table row, and GitHub's Markdown parser
# ends the table right there — the delimiter row renders with an empty body
# and every generated row below it falls through as literal piped text. That
# is not hypothetical; it is what this file's own `id=main` region did until
# the marker moved. Wrapping the header and delimiter in the markers keeps
# every line of the table contiguous, which is what a table requires, while
# the marker comments themselves sit safely outside the contiguous run — one
# line before the header, one line after the last generated row. Both modes
# refuse a region whose first two lines are not a header row and a
# `|---|---|---|` delimiter row.
#
# Both `config-table:start` and `config-table:notes` markers may carry
# trailing prose after the `id=<id>` token and before the closing `-->` —
# the contract that tells an editor who lands on the row directly, without
# having read CLAUDE.md first, that it is generated and where to edit
# instead (#356). Matching a start marker is therefore a prefix match — the
# literal `config-table:start id=<id>` (or `config-table:notes id=<id>`)
# followed by either end-of-line or a space and arbitrary text ending in
# `-->` — never exact-line equality, so any wording after the id is
# accepted and reproduced untouched (the line is `print`ed as found, not
# regenerated). The end markers (`config-table:end`, `config-table:notes-
# end`) carry no id and no per-region prose, so they stay matched exactly.
#
# A Notes cell longer than 500 characters (`NOTES_CAP` in the jq program
# below) is capped: the cell carries a truncated prefix — at most 480
# characters, tokenised into Markdown atoms (a code span, a link, an
# emphasis run, whitespace or a plain word) and cut at the last atom
# boundary that fits, never inside one of those constructs — followed by
# `...[continued below](#extended-notes-<slug>)`, and the note's full text
# is repeated below the table in that document's `config-table:notes`
# region, under a generated `Extended notes: `<key>`` heading. One notes
# region sits beside each table region above, matched by `id`, and renders
# empty when every note in that region fits:
#
#   <!-- config-table:notes id=main -->
#
#   ### Extended notes: `repos`
#
#   ...full note...
#
#   <!-- config-table:notes-end -->
#
# The notes markers are placed by hand, wherever the section reads best in
# the surrounding prose — this script rewrites what sits between them and
# never moves them — and each heading's level is derived, not hard-coded:
# the nearest ATX heading above the start marker, plus one, clamped at 6:
# missing that heading is a hard failure. The anchor is GitHub's own slug for
# that heading (lower-cased, stripped to `[a-z0-9_-]`/space, spaces turned
# to `-`); two headings in one document slugging the same is also a hard
# failure, asserted rather than handled, since the current key sets make it
# impossible. Pipes are not escaped in the notes region — `esc_pipes` exists
# for table cells, where a raw `|` would end one; outside the table an
# escaped pipe would render as a literal `\|`.
#
# With no arguments, every region — table and notes alike — is rewritten in
# place. `--check` renders each region to a temporary file instead and exits
# non-zero — naming the file, the region and the first differing key — the
# moment any region is stale; this is what `.github/workflows/config-table.yml`
# runs on every pull request, the same way `.github/workflows/toc.yml` gates
# `scripts/render-toc.sh`'s own regions.
