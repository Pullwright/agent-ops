#
# Why a *shared* switch rather than one per pipeline: the hazard the switch
# exists for is an agent editing the agent-ops working tree, and this script
# runs out of that same tree and sources that same lib/. An agent that disabled
# only the implementation pipeline and then started editing lib/limit-detect.sh
# would have left the review pipeline free to fire mid-edit and read half of it.
#
# The expired case is left for agent-cycle.sh to clear and log. This pipeline

# distinguish the two modes here the way agent-cycle.sh's own 2.2a-adjacent

# "drain"` record exactly as for a `mode: "stop"` one (mode is an orthogonal
# field on the same record, requirement 2.3d), so no extra check is needed —

# shared between both pipelines (see its comment), so reaching for it here
# would stop the cycles too — a far bigger stand-down than "not this week's

# then defer for. This is the installation-wide value only — a repository's own

# inside skip_reason (R4) once the cycle is under way; that lets an override
# hold one repository off *longer* than this value, but not escape it while it
# is in force.
#
# Self-expiring by construction, which is the whole point of a timestamp over a
# raised `min_days_between_reviews`: the latter has to be put back by hand, and
