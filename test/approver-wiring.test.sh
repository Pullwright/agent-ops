# test/approver-wiring.test.sh — regression test for `run_approver_stage` and
# `approver_stage_complexity`, the code in agent-cycle.sh that turns the
# Approver's tier, refuse streak and verdict into the one GitHub review this
# stage posts (requirements 8b/8c, acceptance check 8s; D18 WI-5,
# agent-ops#408, agent-ops#470).
#
# `test/approver.test.sh` covers lib/approver.sh's own primitives — the tier
# and model lookups, the refuse-streak derivation, the review post. None of
# that says anything about the wiring those primitives hang off, which is
# where this stage's own decisions actually live:
#
#   - **At `human`, nothing happens at all** — no token minted, no review
#     posted, no event logged. The product default must be byte-for-byte the
#     behaviour that shipped before this stage existed, and the only thing
#     standing between the two is one `merge_autonomy_effective_level` read.
#   - **`complexity:low` approves deterministically** — an `APPROVE` review
#     with no model launched at all, which is the whole reason the Trivial
#     tier exists (zero tokens on the tier that carries no behaviour change).
#   - **A refuse streak of two routes to `approver_model_critical`**,
#     *regardless* of what the complexity grade alone would have picked — the
#     disagreement, not the diff, chooses the adjudication tier, so a
#     `complexity:low` pull request on a streak of two must reach Critical
#     and not the deterministic path above.
#   - **An adjudication `refuse` escalates only once it keeps recurring**
#     (agent-ops#1214): below the recurrence threshold (a refuse streak of
#     four — the third consecutive adjudication `refuse`) it posts
#     `REQUEST_CHANGES` and nothing more, returning to `review-feedback` next
#     cycle exactly like an ordinary refusal; at the threshold it also
#     escalates. `escalate` and an unparseable/failed verdict escalate
#     regardless of the streak, unchanged. Every escalating path reports
#     *which* of the three conditions fired, since that is what the
#     escalation issue's own "why" wording is chosen from.
#   - **The ordinary tiers pick their own model** — `medium` on
#     `approver_model_default`, `high` on `approver_model_complex` — and a
#     refusal's `reasons` become the `REQUEST_CHANGES` body a human and the
#     next Implementer read.
#   - **Every failure costs a missing review, never a stranded pull request**:
#     the stage disabled, a verdict that would not parse, or a review GitHub
#     refused, each log a `warning` and return 0.
#   - **The Approver's prompt takes no overrides** — the harness's
#     `prompt_overrides_json` deliberately carries an `approver` key, and
#     `run_approver_stage` must hand `stage_prompt_text` an empty overrides
#     object anyway (requirement 4a, agent-ops#469): the adversarial prompt
#     is the trust gate, and no installation may extend or replace it.
#   - **The tier is resolved after the Reviewer, not before it**
#     (`approver_stage_complexity`, requirement 8b, agent-ops#470): a
#     mid-round `complexity:medium` → `complexity:high` label correction the
#     Reviewer itself made reaches the same round's Approver, raise-never-
#     lower against the pre-Reviewer grade, with an unreadable label leaving
#     the pre-Reviewer grade untouched.
#
# `run_approver_stage` and `approver_stage_complexity` are lifted verbatim out
# of agent-cycle.sh, the same way test/human-reviewer-handoff-wiring.test.sh
# and test/closing-keyword-wiring.test.sh lift their own blocks, so the
# assertions are about the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic.
# lib/approver.sh's pure lookups and lib/cycle-state.sh's `reviewer_complexity`
# (which `approver_stage_complexity` calls to apply the raise-never-lower
# comparison) are sourced for real; everything that talks to GitHub, launches
# a model or writes the log is stubbed and recorded.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/approver-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
#
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
# This file assembles a harness script whose `$`-expressions must reach the
# assembled file unexpanded; the single-quoted here-doc below is deliberate.

# --- Assembly -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The harness sources lib/approver.sh for the real tier/model lookups and
# lib/cycle-state.sh for the real `reviewer_complexity` (the raise-never-lower
# comparison `approver_stage_complexity` calls), then overrides every function
# that reaches outside the process. Each stub records what it was asked to do
# under $tmp_dir, so an assertion can read the calls rather than the
# function's (deliberately always-zero) exit status.
#
# Case inputs arrive as environment variables, so one harness serves every
# case: LEVEL, STREAK, VERDICT (the model's final JSON, or empty for "no
# parseable verdict"), POST_RC, the three model tier values, and
# POST_REVIEW_LABEL/GH_LABEL_RC for the post-Reviewer label read
# `approver_stage_complexity` makes.
