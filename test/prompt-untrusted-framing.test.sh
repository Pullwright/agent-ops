# test/prompt-untrusted-framing.test.sh — the untrusted-external-content
# framing (docs/spec/implementation/requirements/every-stage.md requirement 45,
# docs/spec/review.md R18, docs/spec/monitor.md M10a) is present in
# every prompt that reads forge-authored text, and every copy — the spec's
# canonical one included — is byte-identical.
#
# What this guards: the framing is one rule with eleven copies, which is the
# shape the final-message parser already taught this repo to distrust
# (test/extract-json-result.test.sh): copies drift. A prompt whose copy has
# drifted is enforcing a different rule from the one the spec states; a
# prompt that lost its markers has lost the section entirely — and the
# framing is the one D24 containment that is only words, so the words being
# the decided ones is the whole control. Every copy is lifted from its file
# at run time, never restated here, so this cannot pass against text the
# files have moved on from.
#
# The spec's canonical copy sits indented inside requirement 45a's fenced
# block; the lift strips each copy's own leading indentation (taken from its
# start-marker line) before comparing, so indentation is presentation and
# the words are the contract.
#
# Run directly: ./test/prompt-untrusted-framing.test.sh — exit 0 iff all
# passed.
