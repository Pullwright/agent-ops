# test/stage-end-join-key.test.sh — regression test for the item-lifecycle
# join key (requirement 49, issue #595) on `stage-end` at agent-cycle.sh's own
# two item-scoped sites: the Implementer's and the Reviewer's. Both carry
# `{repo, item}` whenever the cycle knows them, and omit either — never a
# literal `null` — when it does not.
#
# These two sites are the pair a reader is most likely to assume are covered
# by test/stage-budget-apply-join-key.test.sh and are not: that test pins
# `stage-start`, which agent-cycle.sh emits from inside `stage_budget_apply`,
# while every `stage-end` is written at its own call site. `lib/approver.sh`'s
# and `lib/enabler.sh`'s own `stage-end` sites are pinned by
# test/approver-wiring.test.sh and their own siblings.
#
# Lifted verbatim, the same technique test/pr-raised-join-key.test.sh uses, so
# the assertions are about the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/stage-end-join-key.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
