# test/gathered-repo-labels-wiring.test.sh — regression test for the
# per-gathered-repository label ensure agent-cycle.sh's main gather loop runs
# (requirement 6a, agent-ops#687): not whether labels_reconcile_stamped itself is
# correct (test/labels.test.sh covers that) but whether the loop calls it with
# the right arguments, for every repository it gathers — not only the one the
# Co-Ordinator later selects — and logs `labels-ensured` only when there is
# something to report. Alongside it, that agent-cycle.sh actually installs the
# `REFINEMENT_LABEL_ENSURE` hook lib/refinement.sh's self-heal retries through,
# which is a wiring question of exactly the same kind: the retry is
# unreachable in the shipped pipeline unless some file sets the variable, and
# lib/refinement.sh's own tests can only prove the retry works when it is set.
#
# This is the fix for the gap the issue calls out: the Co-Ordinator's own
# `needs_refinement`/`blocked` projection and the Refiner's `refined_label`
# projection both ran across every repository the cycle gathered data for,
# but the label ensure used to run only for the one repository selected to
# work — so a repository nobody had selected work in yet offered neither
# projection anywhere to land. Wiring this into the gather loop closes that;
# this test is what pins the wiring in place rather than the intent.
#
# The block is lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the way
# test/backpressure-wiring.test.sh and test/auth-failure-wiring.test.sh lift
# their own, so the assertions are about the shipped code rather than a copy
# of its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/gathered-repo-labels-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
