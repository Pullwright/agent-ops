# test/candidate-text-compose.test.sh — regression test for `item_live_entry`
# and `compose_selected_candidate_text` (requirement 17h, agent-ops#769,
# resolving agent-ops#844 option (b)).
#
# The owner decision on #844 chose option (b): the Script composes
# `context`/`acceptance`/`title` for the one item the Co-Ordinator (or the
# mechanical fallback, requirement 3v) selects, rather than trusting a model
# running on the fleet's cheapest tier to paste kilobytes of text its own
# input trimming may already have removed. `compose_selected_candidate_text`
# is where that happens: a live fetch for `issues`/`tech-debt` (the only two
# bands the fit ladder — lib/coordinator-input.sh — ever trims), the
# never-trimmed pre-fetched band entry for every other source the Script
# already gathers as structured data, and nothing at all — a deliberate
# no-op — for the three sources the Co-Ordinator still derives itself live
# (`project-review`, `failed-runs`, `implementation-plan`), which have no
# band entry to compose from in the first place.
#
# The functions are lifted verbatim out of lib/candidate-select.sh, the way
# test/item-text-fabrication.test.sh and test/refinement-traceability.test.sh
# lift their own, so the assertions are about the shipped code rather than a
# copy of its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly: ./test/candidate-text-compose.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
