# test/refiner-verdicts.test.sh — regression test for `maybe_run_refiner`'s
# verdict switch in agent-cycle.sh (requirements 39c, 39d, 39e), the piece
# that translates a Refiner engagement's JSON verdicts into log events,
# labels and blocks.
#
# Issues #287/#289: nothing in test/ ever called `maybe_run_refiner`.
# `test/refiner-eligibility.test.sh` covers the candidate set on the other
# side of the loop; nothing drove the switch that consumes the verdicts. That
# gap is exactly how a field-name mismatch between `prompts/refiner.md` (which
# said `spec`) and the switch's consumer (`refinement_record_fields`, which
# reads `refined_spec`) survived to human review on PR #283: a `refined`
# verdict written the way the prompt asked would have been silently degraded
# to `refined-uncorroborated` on every engagement, the specification the
# expensive pass produced discarded, while every event in the log read like an
# ordinary examination. Case (d) below is that defect, pinned from both sides:
# a payload keyed `spec` must not be recorded, and the shipped prompt must
# name `refined_spec`.
#
# The harness follows test/enabler-verdicts.test.sh, the same shape of test
# for `maybe_run_enabler`: the functions under test are lifted whole out of
# agent-cycle.sh with awk, so this cannot pass against a copy the script has
# since moved on from, and the library functions the switch actually depends
# on for correctness — `refinement_record_fields`, `refinement_entry_problem`,
# `refinement_issue_number`, `refinement_block_fields`,
# `refiner_engagement_set` (lib/refinement.sh), `item_event_fields`
# (lib/cycle-state.sh), `label_own_action_fields` (lib/label-marker.sh),
# `pipeline_actor_label` (lib/pipeline-marker.sh) — are sourced for real, so
# what is exercised is the genuine recording path rather than a paraphrase of
# it. Everything with a side effect outside the process — `claude` itself,
# `gh` (via the REFINEMENT_GH hook the library already exposes for tests),
# the state-repo claim registry — is stubbed.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run it
# directly:
#
#   ./test/refiner-verdicts.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
