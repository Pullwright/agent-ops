# test/labels.test.sh — self-contained regression test for lib/labels.sh
# (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md requirement 6a).
#
# The two failure directions are not alike, and only one of them is loud:
#
#   - **Too shy** is what this requirement exists to fix, and it is silent: a
#     label that does not exist means the projection onto an item quietly does
#     not happen, the pipeline carries on, and the human never sees the signal.
#     So every label the product applies is asserted to be created when absent,
#     for each of the three roles a repository can play.
#   - **Too eager** is the new risk it introduces. Creating a label that is
#     already there is refused by GitHub and would be reported as a failure;
#     *modifying* one that is already there would silently undo an operator's
#     own colour and description on a schedule, every cycle, for as long as
#     nobody noticed. So this asserts not only that existing labels are left
#     alone but that no request other than a listing and a create is ever
#     issued at all.
#
# `gh` is stubbed, recording every invocation, so the assertions are about the
# requests the library actually makes rather than about a copy of its logic.
# No network is used and nothing is created anywhere real.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo); this is a
# plain bash script with hand-rolled assertions. Run it directly:
#
#   ./test/labels.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# --- The stub. `LABELS_GH` is the seam lib/labels.sh leaves for exactly this.
#     It reproduces the calls the library makes and the shapes GitHub answers
#     them with: a listing (names only, or full name/colour/description when
#     the caller's own --jq filter asks for colour), a create that refuses a
#     duplicate, and — for labels_reconcile's own CRUD — an update and a
#     delete addressed by the label's name in the URL path, percent-encoded
#     exactly as a real colon-carrying label name would be. $GH_LABELS itself
#     always holds `name<TAB>colour<TAB>description` lines; a bare name with
#     no tabs (every pre-existing test's own seed) is its own first field, so
#     the two storage shapes coexist without conversion.
