# test/signal-exit.test.sh — a signal leaves a record, a released claim, and no
# orphaned model (implementation spec requirement 9c / acceptance check 4a;
# review spec R7a).
#
# What this guards: the kills that reach a cycle script are real and routine —
# a peer taking over a stale lock TERMs the whole process group, an operator
# stops a container, a `--once` run is interrupted at the terminal. Before the
# handler under test existed, any of them ended bash between one statement and
# the next: no `attempt-failed`, no claim release, no `cycle-end` — and the
# stage's own process group, which `set -m` detaches precisely so the timeout
# can kill it whole, kept a model running for a cycle that was already dead.
# Every stale-lock takeover in the July logs left exactly that nothing behind.
#
# The machinery is lifted out of each script rather than restated here, so this
# cannot pass against a copy the script has since moved on from; the extraction
# asserts it found something for the same reason. The signalled process is a
# real second process assembled from the lifted parts plus recording stubs —
# signal semantics are the one thing a same-process eval cannot exercise.
# `claude` is a stub that records its pid and sleeps; no network, no model, no
# cost.
#
# Run directly: ./test/signal-exit.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.

# script. Since issue #2133, lib/stage-run.sh itself also sources
# lib/substrate-claude-code.sh (the Claude adapter — the launch argv and
# prompt delivery this test's own sanity check below looks for moved there),
# so it is lifted too — and so, since issue #2134, is
# lib/substrate-grok-build.sh, the second adapter lib/stage-run.sh sources the
# same way; `assemble_and_signal` additionally drops a real copy of each
# adapter file beside the assembled script, because the embedded
