# test/auth-failure-wiring.test.sh — regression test for requirement 2.0b's
# GitHub credential check in agent-cycle.sh (agent-ops#691): not whether
# `github_auth_probe` classifies a 401 correctly (test/github-limit.test.sh
# covers that in isolation) but whether the cycle actually acts on the
# classification — standing down with the right reason and escalating,
# before anything downstream (the Co-Ordinator most of all) ever runs.
#
# The incident this guards: a node's `GH_TOKEN` expired, and every cycle for
# ~3 hours ran a full Co-Ordinator engagement ($0.21 each) before every claim
# failed with `cause: "unreachable"` — a 401 folded into the same bucket as a
# network blip, so the stand-down read "this is an outage, not contention"
# and nobody went looking at the token. The three things worth asserting
# here are exactly the three the issue's acceptance criteria named:
#
#   - **`unauthorized` stands the cycle down before the block falls through**
#     — this test never reaches a Co-Ordinator call because the extracted
#     block is everything that runs before one; if the block did not `exit 0`
#     here, a real cycle would carry on into it (asserted as "FELL THROUGH"
#     never appearing for this mode).
#   - **The stand-down reason names the credential problem, not a generic
#     outage** — the exact wording the issue asked for, not "GitHub could not
#     be reached for any candidate".
#   - **It escalates through `create_escalation_issue`**, the same
#     fleet-scoped, deduplicated route 1c's usage-limit freeze and 2.7's
#     crash loop already use — not `escalation_autonomy`, which is scoped to
#     Enabler refinement-disagreements alone (see the block's own comment).
#
# Also asserts the two cases requirement 2.0b must leave alone: `ok`
# credentials fall through to the rest of the cycle untouched, and
# `unreachable` (a network fault, not a rejection) is left for the existing
# claim-loop classification to handle rather than being escalated here.
#
# The block is lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the way
# test/backpressure-wiring.test.sh and
# test/gathered-repo-labels-wiring.test.sh lift
# their own, so the assertions are about the shipped code rather than a copy
# of its logic.
#
# No network: `github_auth_probe` and `create_escalation_issue` are both
# stubs, the second recording the argv and body it was handed.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
# ./test/auth-failure-wiring.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
