# test/crash-loop.test.sh — a fleet-wide crash loop, of either class
# requirement 2.7 detects, is detected once and escalated once (acceptance
# check 5a).
#
# What this guards: a Co-Ordinator failure pins no repo/item, so the blocked →
# Enabler → escalation ladder never sees it, and the cycle still ends 0. On
# 2026-08-01 a deterministic failure shipped in the image (`coordinator exited
# 126`), every node failed identically every hour for ~15 hours, and the
# dashboard showed four healthy idle nodes throughout. `lib/crash-loop.sh` is
# the rung that class now has; these are its properties, each of which fails
# silently if lost:
#
#   identical detail       one timeout plus one unparseable message is noise,
#                          not a loop — mixed details must reset the count
#   any success resets     a fleet that is mostly working is not crash-looping,
#                          however many failures a week accumulates
#   ordering is truth      an "unparseable final message" failure follows its
#                          own stage-end 0; that cycle is one failure, not a
#                          continuation of the run the success just ended
#   escalated once         the same run must not file an issue every hour; a
#                          NEW run with the SAME detail, after the old issue
#                          closed, must file afresh
#
# `crash_loop_preselection_verdict` covers the class the Co-Ordinator check
# above cannot see: a cycle that dies while assembling its own runtime input,
# before `stage-start` for any stage is ever logged, so no `attempt-failed`
# exists for anything to count (TD-PPagop-26081302 — the 2026-08-01 argv-cap
# outage and the 2026-08-12 void-extract one both took this shape). It shares
# the same properties above, grouped by `exit_code` instead of `detail` since
# a pre-selection death carries no detail string, and a completed cycle
# reaching a selection-path stage (`coordinator`, `implementer`, `reviewer`)
# resets it exactly as a success does — reaching selection proves the systemic
# block is not reproducing right now. A cleanup-path stage (`enabler`,
# `refiner`) never resets: those start after a pre-selection death has already
# happened, so counting them as recovery would silence the alarm the moment
# their non-zero-exit guards were relaxed.
#
# No network: all three functions are pure readers of an event stream on
# stdin.
#
# Run directly: ./test/crash-loop.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.

# --- The 2026-09-05 fleet flap, reproduced with the incident's own
# timestamps (issues #1164-#1170) --------------------------------------------
#
# Six enabler-escalation issues in four hours, every one the identical
# detail, each retired within minutes of a lone fleet-wide success before
# that same detail resumed failing and re-crossed threshold — read by the
# guards that existed before this fix as a "new" run each time. This
# reproduces the real first two runs' own timestamps end to end and proves
# the two facts requirement 2.7's hysteresis rests on: a verdict computed
# once a clearing success is already in the log never fires — a resolved
# run reads as no run at all, so there is no "late" filing decision to make
# — and the very failures that make the second flap a continuation of the
# first run's own incident, rather than an unrelated new one, are exactly
# what `crash_loop_detail_recurred_since` sees. `crash_loop_retire_resolved`
# consults that primitive before it will close the first run's issue, which
# is what stops the second flap from ever reaching `create_escalation_issue`
# with no open issue left to find — one page for the run family, not two.
