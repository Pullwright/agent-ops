# test/verdict-fate.test.sh — regression test for lib/verdict-fate.sh, the
# pure join and classification behind the D18 Approver-verdict/human-action
# divergence record (agent-ops#573).
#
# Four things are asserted:
#
#   - `verdict_fate_posted_review` maps the model's own vocabulary
#     (`approve`/`refuse`/`land`/`escalate`, plus `adjudication`) onto the
#     two GitHub review events the Script ever actually posts, printing empty
#     for anything that reaches neither.
#   - `verdict_fate_latest_per_pr` collapses a pull request with more than
#     one `approver-verdict` event to its single latest by `ts`; excludes a
#     verdict whose review never reached GitHub (`posted:false`, or an
#     escalate/unrecognised verdict with no `posted_review` at all) while
#     defaulting a pre-agent-ops#573 event with no `posted` field at all to
#     `true` (the best available assumption for history this file cannot
#     re-observe); matches a repo prefix exactly, the same
#     no-substring-match discipline `scripts/autonomy-stage-report.sh`'s own
#     `crit_agent_approved_prs` already applies (a `o/repo-extra` decoy must
#     never count toward `o/repo`); derives `repo` from `pr_url` rather than
#     trusting the event's own field (docs/spec/implementation/README.md
#     requirement 33), so a pre-agent-ops#573 event with no `repo` field at
#     all still reports one; and carries `first_approve_ts` as the *earliest*
#     `ts` among that pull request's own APPROVE verdicts, not the latest
#     verdict's `ts` — a pull request approved, sent a standing human
#     `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, and re-approved must still surface that first
#     approval's timestamp so the divergence is never silently dropped
#     (agent-ops#661).
#   - `verdict_fate_classify` covers every fate/comparison pair the issue's
#     own vocabulary names: an APPROVE landing by the Script or by a human
#     (agreement), an APPROVE closing unmerged (divergence), an APPROVE with
#     a standing human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` afterwards — its own fate,
#     `changes-requested-after-approval`, never collapsed into
#     `closed-unmerged` even when the pull request is later fixed and merged
#     anyway (the issue's stated "sharp edge") — a REQUEST_CHANGES closing
#     unmerged (agreement) or landing anyway (divergence, a human override),
#     and a still-open pull request with no standing request (pending,
#     either verdict).
#   - `verdict_fate_summarize` computes agreement/divergence/pending/sample/
#     rate correctly and declines to state a rate below the stated minimum
#     sample (`insufficient-sample`), the same "never state a rate a handful
#     of data points cannot support" discipline this issue's acceptance
#     criteria name.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/verdict-fate.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# --- The two together, on the sequence agent-ops#661 was raised about --------

# Both halves of that fix pass in isolation above; the defect lived in their
# composition. pull/5 in EVENTS is approved at 2026-08-06 and re-approved at
# 2026-08-08 — the `review-feedback` source bringing a pull request back round
# after a human asked for changes — so a human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` at
# 2026-08-07 falls between the two. Fed `verdict_fate_latest_per_pr`'s own
# output, as both callers do, that pull request must still record a
# divergence; read against the *latest* verdict's `ts` the human's review looks
# like it came first and the signal disappears, which is the whole defect.
