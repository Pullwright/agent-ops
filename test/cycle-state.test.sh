# test/cycle-state.test.sh — self-contained regression test for
# lib/cycle-state.sh, plus (requirement 3u, issue #320) the agent-cycle.sh
# functions that read this file's `blocked_items`/`void_items` output to
# decide what the Co-Ordinator is allowed to see, since that decision is what
# requirement 18a's mandatory re-check depends on and belongs alongside it.
#
# Covers the two defects that let a stale work order (review-2026-07-11-R-01,
# "Add a licence" — already done on main) be re-selected nine times, each time
# paying for a full Implementer run that correctly reported `blocked` and was
# then forgotten:
#
#   1. read_pr_url_breadcrumb returned non-zero when no PR had been opened,
#      which under `set -e` aborted the cycle at its call site — before the
#      blocked verdict could be logged at all.
#   2. attempt-failed events carried no `item`, so the blocked extract (which
#      keys on repo+item) could never match the item that had failed.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo); this is a
# plain bash script with hand-rolled assertions. Run it directly:
#
#   ./test/cycle-state.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
