# test/monitor-cycle.test.sh — the Pipeline Monitor end to end
# (agent-ops#1284, docs/MONITOR-PIPELINE-SPEC.md).
#
# Every case here drives the **real** `monitor-cycle.sh` against a shim node:
# a directory of symlinks back into the tree with its own `config.json`, which
# works because the script takes SCRIPT_DIR from its own path and reads its
# config from beside itself. Two stubs stand in for everything outside the
# process — `claude`, which returns a canned findings object, and `gh`, which
# records every call and answers the listings — so the assertions are about
# what the Script *did*, not about what a library would have done if called.
#
# The five behaviours this file exists for, and why each would fail quietly:
#
#   the budget      four findings must file three and defer the fourth **with
#                   its key**. A deferral that lost the key is indistinguishable
#                   next run from a finding nobody ever stated, so the fault
#                   would silently drop out of the record rather than being
#                   re-offered.
#   the dedup       a second run restating the same keys must file nothing and
#                   cite the open issues. Without it the Monitor's own
#                   persistence — restating a fault that is still true, which
#                   the prompt asks for — turns into a duplicate every day.
#   the tactical    gate `monitor_tactical_keys` is empty by default, and a
#                   tactical finding must then produce a proposal and **no**
#                   `pw::decision`. This is the one path where the pipeline
#                   would be acting on its own authority, and "gated closed"
#                   is the whole claim.
#   the page rule   a mechanical page gets one comment linking its fix; no page
#                   is ever closed here. A close from this script would leave
#                   the union log saying `fired` for ever, so the invariant
#                   could never clear and never fire again — a failure with no
#                   symptom until the next real incident.
#   the cadence     an hourly tick that is neither due nor pager-triggered
#                   must launch no model. The cost of getting this wrong is
#                   24 Sonnet runs a day, invisible except on the bill.
#
# Plus the stage-health verdict (M17), the role guard and the switch.
#
# No network: `state_repo` is empty in every fixture (which makes the slot
# claim vacuously won, `lib/claim.sh`), and the stub `gh`/`claude` are ahead of
# everything on PATH.
#
# Run directly: ./test/monitor-cycle.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
