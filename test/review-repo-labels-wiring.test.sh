# test/review-repo-labels-wiring.test.sh — regression test for the
# per-repository label ensure review-cycle.sh's review_one function runs
# (requirement R5.0b, agent-ops#685): not whether labels_reconcile_role itself
# is correct (test/labels.test.sh covers that) but whether review_one calls it
# with the right arguments and logs `labels-ensured` only when there is
# something to report. Also verifies that it calls the plain, unstamped
# `labels_reconcile_role` and not the rate-limited `labels_ensure_stamped`/
# `labels_reconcile_stamped` — a one-line distinction that matters but is
# otherwise guarded only by a comment.
#
# The block is lifted verbatim out of review-cycle.sh, the way
# test/gathered-repo-labels-wiring.test.sh and test/backpressure-wiring.test.sh
# lift their own, so the assertions are about the shipped code rather than a
# copy of its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/review-repo-labels-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
