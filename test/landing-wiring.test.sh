# test/landing-wiring.test.sh — regression test for `run_landing_stage` and
# `_landing_refuse`, the code in agent-cycle.sh that turns lib/landing.sh's
# classifier and arming primitives into the one place a pull request lands
# without a human click (requirement 8d, "## The Landing Gate"; D18 WI-7,
# agent-ops#410).
#
# `test/landing.test.sh` covers lib/landing.sh's own primitives — the
# protected-path classifier, `landing_eligible`, `landing_arm`. None of that
# says anything about the six-gate sequence those primitives hang off, which
# is where this stage's decisions actually live, and every one of the issue's
# own acceptance criteria is a statement about *that* sequence:
#
#   - **Nothing this round's Approver did not explicitly approve arms
#     anything** — a refusal, an unparseable verdict, a stage that never ran,
#     and an adjudication's own `land` all leave the stage silent (not even a
#     `landing-refused`: there was no landing decision to refuse).
#   - **Every gate that refuses costs exactly one `landing-refused` event** —
#     never a blocked pull request, never a withheld claim, and never a
#     non-zero return, the same contract 8b establishes for the Approver.
#   - **Every gate that cannot be *read* refuses too**, never passes.
#
# The harness runs under `set -euo pipefail`, the shell options agent-cycle.sh
# itself sets (line 6) — not the `set -uo pipefail` the library tests use.
# That is the point of this file rather than an incidental detail: under
# `errexit` a bare `var="$(helper)"` assignment does not merely discard a
# non-zero status, it aborts the cycle mid-stage, so a gate helper that
# reports its refusal *in its exit status* (`review_gate_verdict` returns 1
# for `dirty` and 2 for an unreadable required-check list) can only be
# regression-tested for "refuses cleanly" under the options production runs
# with. Assertions below check the stage's own exit status as carefully as
# its events for exactly that reason.
#
# `run_landing_stage` and `_landing_refuse` are lifted verbatim out of
# agent-cycle.sh, the same way test/approver-wiring.test.sh and
# test/closing-keyword-wiring.test.sh lift their own blocks, so the
# assertions are about the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic.
# Everything that reaches outside the process — every gate helper, the
# arming write, the log — is stubbed and recorded.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/landing-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
#
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
# This file assembles a harness script whose `$`-expressions must reach the
# assembled file unexpanded; the single-quoted here-doc and `printf` lines
