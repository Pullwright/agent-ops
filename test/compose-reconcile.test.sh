# test/compose-reconcile.test.sh — the compose reconciler (lib/compose-
# reconcile.sh): what applies a merged compose.yaml to a node without a human,
# the way watchtower applies a merged image.
#
# The properties that matter, each one a way the thing could be worse than the
# manual ritual it replaces:
#
#   - it acts only on drift, and a second run after a successful one does
#     nothing at all — an actor on a five-minute tick that is not idempotent
#     recreates a node's whole stack every five minutes;
#   - a `${VAR}` the new file requires and the node's `.env` does not define
#     refuses the whole apply, changing nothing: compose would otherwise
#     interpolate an empty string and `up -d` would deploy it;
#   - a `${VAR:-default}` is not such a variable, and neither is `$$VAR` nor a
#     shell fragment in a comment — a scan that cannot tell those apart
#     refuses every node for ever;
#   - a cycle in flight defers it, exactly as `watchtower-pre-update.sh`
#     defers a roll, and the roll-pending marker overrides `lock.json` alone;
#   - a recreate that failed is retried even though the file it installed has
#     already cleared the drift that would otherwise be the only thing asking;
#   - the file is replaced *in place*, keeping its inode, because a bind mount
#     of a file pins the inode it was created against;
#   - `.env` is never written, and its values are never read;
#   - every event is a transition, not a tick.
#
# `docker` is stubbed throughout: this suite creates no container and reaches
# no socket. Every path the library reads is given explicitly
# (COMPOSE_RECONCILE_PROJECT_DIR / _IMAGE_FILE / _STATE_DIR / _CONFIG /
# _DOCKER / _NOW), the same way test/compose-drift.test.sh gives its own,
# because the CI suite runs inside the image where the defaults would answer
# for the build container instead of the fixture.
#
# Run directly: ./test/compose-reconcile.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
