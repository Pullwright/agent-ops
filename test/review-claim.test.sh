# test/review-claim.test.sh — the review-branch claim wiring (R5.0/R5c).
#
# lib/claim.sh's own semantics are covered by test/claim.test.sh; what this
# suite pins is the *wiring*: that review-cycle.sh claims `review/<date>`
# before anything expensive, skips the repo on a lost claim AND on a claim
# error (fail closed), and releases on the failure path — the leak the
# implementation pipeline fixed in its own workspace path (#55) must not be
# reintroduced here.
#
# All three outcomes run inside a single real review-cycle.sh invocation
# (issue #969): review-cycle.sh processes every configured repository in one
# pass (R6's usage-limit re-check between repos assumes exactly that), so
# three synthetic repositories — one pre-claimed by another node, one whose
# claim can never reach GitHub, one that wins its claim and then fails to
# clone — exercise all three outcomes while paying this file's dominant cost
# (sourcing every lib/*.sh review-cycle.sh sources, regardless of what is
# tested) exactly once instead of three times. The one CLAIM_GH stub tells
# the three apart by the target slug in the path it is called with, which is
# the same seam each scenario always keyed off — nothing here removes an
# assertion, only reads it off a shared run.
#
# Offline throughout: `gh` and `claude` on PATH fail fast (the skip-guards
# degrade to "proceed", no model ever runs), `CLONE_GIT=/bin/false` fails the
# clone, the claim goes through CLAIM_GH to the same filesystem-CAS stub
# test/claim.test.sh uses, TOGGLE_GH fails like an unreachable state repo
# (fleet flags fall back to enabled), and the cleanup push lands in a local
# bare repository.
#
# The clone gets its own seam rather than riding on the `gh` shim, and that is
# the whole reason `lib/repo-clone.sh` is a function. While the pipeline ran
# `gh repo clone`, the fail-fast `gh` on PATH failed the clone as a side
# effect; when it became `git clone` (to stop paying GraphQL for a repository
# resolve), nothing on PATH stood in the way and the clone reached the network
# — so these four assertions passed on a machine without egress and failed on
# both CI runners, which is the worst way round for a test to be wrong. A test
# that needs a step to fail must be the thing that fails it.
#
# Run directly:
#
#   ./test/review-claim.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
