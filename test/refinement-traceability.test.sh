# test/refinement-traceability.test.sh — regression test for
# `refinement_traceability_fault` (requirement 17f, agent-ops#626).
#
# Reproduces the #571/#529 join fault: a work order for issue #571 was
# assembled carrying issue #529's own refinement comment content in its
# `acceptance` field instead of #571's own. The Co-Ordinator's response was
# syntactically fine and #571's candidate individually plausible, so nothing
# caught the cross-item swap until the Implementer — handed nothing but the
# mismatched work order — found it incoherent and burned the item's one
# refinement-per-human-touch allowance re-flagging it `needs-refinement`.
#
# `refinement_traceability_fault` closes that gap by re-deriving the item's
# own recorded refinement from `refinements-json` (never from anything the
# candidate itself claims) and confirming it is genuinely present, verbatim,
# in the candidate's own `context`/`acceptance`.
#
# The function is lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the way
# test/coordinator-refinements.test.sh lifts its own, so the assertions are
# about the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly: ./test/refinement-traceability.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
