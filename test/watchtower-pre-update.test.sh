# test/watchtower-pre-update.test.sh — the hook that makes an image roll wait.
#
# The properties that matter:
#   - a live implementation cycle defers the roll (exit 75, EX_TEMPFAIL), and
#     so does a live review — either one dying to a roll costs the same;
#   - an idle node exits 0, so a node with nothing running still updates;
#   - a lock past its pipeline's `lock_stale_after` does NOT defer. This is
#     the property that stops one wedged process freezing a node's image for
#     ever: the hook protects exactly what a cycle would have respected, and
#     a cycle would have taken that lock over;
#   - only the container that wrote a lock judges it by pid. Any other reader
#     — the dashboard shares the scheduler's state volume but not its PID
#     namespace — honours the lock until released or stale, in both
#     directions: a pid that reads as dead here may be a live cycle next
#     door, and one that reads as alive may be an unrelated local process
#     (#130);
#   - anything the hook cannot read fails *open*, because a node that quietly
#     stops updating is worse than a roll that lands badly once;
#   - a `roll-pending` marker (agent-ops#1096) overrides a live, fresh
#     lock.json as an unconditional allow, until it expires — the mechanism a
#     healthy node running long or chained cycles relies on to actually get a
#     roll, rather than merely being bounded by `lock_stale_after` the way a
#     wedged one is. It never extends to review-lock.json (agent-ops#1102):
#     a project review never wrote the marker and never yielded anything;
#   - a compose apply in flight defers the roll (agent-ops#1913). The
#     `reconciler` service recreates this whole project when a merged
#     compose.yaml reaches the node, and a roll landing in the middle of that
#     has watchtower and Compose stopping the same containers at once. The
#     marker is bounded: one left behind by an apply whose container died
#     mid-way stops deferring anything, because a node that quietly stops
#     updating is the worse failure.
#
# Run directly: ./test/watchtower-pre-update.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
