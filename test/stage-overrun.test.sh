# test/stage-overrun.test.sh — the dashboard rule that catches a stage which has
# outlived its own timeout.
#
# The gap this guards: `lock_stale_after` bounds how long a *cycle* may
# plausibly run (4 hours), but agent-cycle.sh bounds each *stage* far more
# tightly — run_model_stage kills the process group when the stage timeout
# expires and logs `stage-end` after it. A Co-Ordinator is capped at 15 minutes,
# so a node rolled mid-cycle used to go on reporting "coordinator choosing work"
# for the remaining three and three-quarter hours before anything on the page
# doubted it. That is most of the way to its next cycle.
#
# Three properties here are the ones worth holding still, because each fails
# silently and in a different direction:
#
#   measured to the heartbeat  a missing `stage-end` is known only as far as the
#                              state that node last published. Measuring to the
#                              clock instead would flag every stage that ended
#                              just after its final push — and would drag the
#                              skew between two machines into the arithmetic,
#                              where measuring one node against its own two
#                              timestamps has none
#   per-stage timeouts         an Implementer gets 120 minutes and a Co-Ordinator
#                              15; one shared threshold would either miss the
#                              Co-Ordinator case entirely or condemn every
#                              healthy Implementer
#   silence on unknown stages  the review pipeline runs stages this map does not
#                              name, and a stage with no configured timeout is
#                              one the rule may make no claim about
#
# The rule is read out of dashboard/index.html rather than restated here, so
# this cannot pass against a copy that the page has since moved on from; the
# extraction asserts it found something for the same reason.
#
# This is the first test of any of `dashboard/index.html`'s JavaScript, and it
# takes only the easy half of TD26072606: a pure function, called directly, with
# no DOM in sight. The `test/dashboard-render.test.sh` that record asks for —
# fixture `DASHBOARD_DATA` through a stub DOM, asserting on rendered cells — is
# still open, and this is not it.
#
# No network. Needs node, which the image carries for the Claude CLI; absent, the
# file skips with a note rather than failing, as TD26072606 asks for and as
# test/render-crontab.test.sh does for supercronic.
#
# Run directly: ./test/stage-overrun.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
