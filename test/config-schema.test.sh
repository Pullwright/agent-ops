# test/config-schema.test.sh — self-contained regression test for
# config.schema.json, lib/config-schema.sh and the configuration half of
# scripts/doctor.sh (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md requirement 4c).
#
# Three things are asserted, and they fail in different directions:
#
#   - **The shipped config validates.** If it ever stops doing so the schema
#     and the system have diverged, and since agent-cycle.sh does not read the
#     schema, the pipeline would go on running while the check that is supposed
#     to describe it says it cannot. That is the one failure here that means
#     the *schema* is wrong rather than the config.
#   - **Every keyword the schema uses is enforced.** A validator that silently
#     ignores a keyword is worse than no validator: the operator is told the
#     config is fine. So each keyword config.schema.json actually uses is
#     exercised with a value that must be rejected — and the rule that the
#     schema may only use keywords lib/config-schema.sh implements is itself
#     asserted, by reading the keywords out of the schema and comparing them
#     against the supported set.
#   - **doctor.sh's cross-key rules fire.** These are the checks the schema
#     cannot express, each mirroring a startup guard in agent-cycle.sh or a
#     requirement whose breach is silent. They are asserted through the shipped
#     script, so what is tested is doctor.sh rather than a restatement of its
#     logic.
#
# **What this file may and may not read from config.json.** Two assertions are
# about the shipped file — that it validates, and that doctor.sh passes it —
# and every other case is a mutation of test/fixtures/config-base.json, a
# configuration this suite owns. Nothing here asserts a *value* the shipped
# file carries, so changing one is a configuration change and nothing else:
# raising a threshold, promoting an autonomy rung or adding a repository must
# never oblige anyone to edit a test. That rule was learnt the expensive way —
# TD-PPagop-26081801, TD-PPagop-26082201 and TD-PPagop-26082302 are all the
# same failure, a fixture silently inheriting state it never named, patched
# one key at a time — and a shared base only postpones it: the fix is that the
# base is not the live installation at all. A fixture that wants a key set
# says so in its own mutation; one that wants it unset deletes it.
#
# The shipped config's own keys are still covered, because the schema is what
# both files are read against: a key added to config.json without a schema
# entry fails the first assertion below, on the shipped file, exactly as
# before.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo); this is a
# plain bash script with hand-rolled assertions. Run it directly:
#
#   ./test/config-schema.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed. No network is used — doctor.sh
# is always invoked with --offline.

# doctor.sh against an already-built fixture and grades the result; shared by
# assert_doctor and assert_doctor_shipped below, which differ only in how
# they build the fixture the check runs against.
#
# Clears the three Approver runtime-credential variables from doctor.sh's own
# environment before running it, the same way the base fixture leaves their
# config.json counterparts unset before a fixture's own mutation runs: on a
# host where these are set for real (the deployed container, where doctor.sh
# ordinarily runs), lib/approver-token.sh's own reconciliation
# (scripts/doctor.sh, requirement 14b) compares a fixture's constructed
# approver_app_id against that real value rather than an absent one, and a
# fixture that never mentions the Approver's runtime credential must not
# silently inherit it (TD-PPagop-26082201). A fixture that wants one of these
# variables set cannot go through assert_doctor/assert_doctor_shipped at all:
# it must call doctor.sh directly, setting the variable for that one
# invocation, the way the PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_APP_ID mismatch check below
# does. Prefixing the assert_doctor call itself would not work anyway — the
# `env -u` below clears all three — and, since the cache described next is
# keyed on the fixture's content alone, it would silently grade a run made
# under a different environment.
#
# A handful of call sites below build byte-identical fixtures on purpose —
# most visibly the six assert_doctor_shipped cases that pass the shipped
# config.json through untouched, each to check a different substring of the
# same run — and on this host a single doctor.sh invocation against that
# fixture costs several real seconds (it walks the fleet's own accumulated
# log history under state_dir, which for the shipped config is this
# installation's real one). The env clearing above and the --offline flag are
# the same for every call here, so doctor.sh's output is otherwise a pure
# function of the fixture's content; _DOCTOR_CACHE_OUT/_DOCTOR_CACHE_STATUS
# key that output by the fixture file's own content hash, so a repeat of the
# exact same fixture reuses the prior run's real output instead of spawning
# doctor.sh again. This changes nothing about what is asserted — each call
# site still grades its own substring against a real doctor.sh run, just not
# always a freshly-spawned one. A fixture that differs by even one byte keys
# differently and spawns afresh, so content is safe; what the key cannot see
# is the environment, which is why every call site here has to keep sharing
