# test/is-docs-only.test.sh — self-contained regression test for
# scripts/is-docs-only.sh, the classifier that lets a documentation-only change
# skip the image build (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md acceptance check
# 1b).
#
# What is really being pinned here is the direction of the mistakes. Calling
# code "prose" means a change to what a node runs never reaches a node; calling
# prose "code" costs a build nobody needed. So most of the assertions below are
# about the first kind — `prompts/*.md` above all, which are Markdown documents
# and are also the pipeline's operating instructions.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo); this is a
# plain bash script with hand-rolled assertions. Run it directly:
#
#   ./test/is-docs-only.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
