# test/repo-entry-build.test.sh — regression test for agent-cycle.sh's
# per-repo entry build (requirement 4g, TD-PPagop-26081406): the inline block
# in the main gather loop that assembles one repo's whole
# findings/review_feedback/abandoned_drafts/merge_conflicts/dequeued/
# landing_refusals/register_hygiene/issues/tech_debt bands, plus its
# slug/default_branch/sources/
# implementation_plan_path, into the single `entry` object folded into
# `ordered_repos_json` — the Co-Ordinator's whole per-repo runtime input.
#
# Each of the nine bands is unbounded past this call — issue threads
# (requirement 3d/#118) and the open tech-debt register (requirement 3t/#310)
# included — and used to ride into jq as nine separate --argjson flags. Past
# MAX_ARG_STRLEN (131072 bytes) the build died at execve, silently dropping
# the repo's whole entry from the Co-Ordinator's input for the cycle.
# Requirement 4g moves all nine onto stdin, one document per line, bound
# positionally with `input as $name` in the order printed — `$sources` alone
# stays in argv, bounded by configuration.
#
# The block is inline, not a function (it runs once per repo inside
# agent-cycle.sh's main gather loop), so it is lifted by its own literal
# start/end lines — the same technique test/pr-claim-exclusion.test.sh's
# `extract_claims_fold` uses for the identical shape one call downstream
# (the `ordered_repos_json` append this entry itself feeds).
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/repo-entry-build.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
