# test/handoff.test.sh — regression test for lib/handoff.sh (requirements 31a
# and 9).
#
# Two functions, two halves of one promise: that a pull request this pipeline
# opened reaches a human. `confirm_pr_ready` covers the half where the PR is
# known and the handoff was claimed but not performed; `pr_url_for_branch`
# covers the half below it, where the stage died without ever saying which pull
# request it had opened — at which point nothing above can run at all.
#
# The defect: a Reviewer answered `{"status": "ready", "ci": "passing"}` for a
# pull request whose work was complete and whose checks were green, never ran
# `gh pr ready`, and the Script logged `pr-ready` from the report alone. The PR
# stayed a draft — invisible to the human, who watches for review requests —
# while the log recorded a successful handoff. Three hours on, the
# abandoned-drafts source re-detected it as a stalled draft at a fresh head SHA,
# which is a fresh ref no block covers, and paid an Implementer and a Reviewer to
# finish finished work. On the hour, indefinitely, every cycle looking productive.
#
# So the assertions below are all one assertion in different clothes: the word
# this function prints must come from GitHub's answer, never from the caller's
# hope. In particular an API that will not answer must read as `failed` — the
# one direction where a wrong guess is silent.
#
# `gh` is stubbed through HANDOFF_GH, the same way lib/claim.sh's tests stub
# theirs; the stub keeps the draft flag in a file so a flip is observable.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo); this is a
# plain bash script with hand-rolled assertions. Run it directly:
#
#   ./test/handoff.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# is a no-op and nothing else puts it in front of the human. Their review
# request was consumed the moment they submitted the review that asked for the
# changes, and the author cannot clear `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. poetic-fiddle #200
# sat like that — reviewed, answered, pushed, commented — until a human went
# looking for it.
#
# `_handoff_blocking_reviewers` and `_handoff_pending_review_targets` (through
# it, `confirm_review_requested`) now both ask `_handoff_pr_query`'s one
# GraphQL query (agent-ops#1085) rather than two separate REST endpoints, so
# the stub answers one call shape, applying whichever `--jq` filter the real
# call handed it — the same "read the filter back out of argv, never a copy
# of it" discipline `ensure_human_reviewer`'s own stub below already uses, so
# a regression in the production filter is what fails these assertions,
# never a difference from a hand-written copy of it. State:
#   $tmp_dir/reviews   the reviews array, verbatim REST-shaped JSON (the
#                      `review()` helper below builds it; the stub folds it
#                      into the GraphQL document's own `reviews.nodes` shape)
#   $tmp_dir/pending   the pending reviewers' logins, one per line
#   $tmp_dir/post      "works" | "silent" — whether the POST changes `pending`
#   $tmp_dir/calls     how many `api graphql` calls have been made so far —
#                      each of `_handoff_blocking_reviewers`/`_handoff_

# (requirement 38a). poetic-fiddle #170: approved, green, idle 6.8 days, nobody
# ever asked again once the review that approved it consumed the request that
# put it in front of a human. `confirm_review_requested` correctly answers
# `none` here — nothing is CHANGES_REQUESTED — which is exactly the case this
# function exists to cover.
#
# The stub answers everything `ensure_human_reviewer` reads. `_handoff_
# blocking_reviewers`, `_handoff_known_reviewers`, `_handoff_pr_author` and
# `_handoff_pending_review_targets` each ask fresh (agent-ops#1085's `_handoff_

# targets one call and not another is expressed as a call number, the same
# `$tmp_dir/calls` mechanism `confirm_review_requested`'s own stub above uses,
# never a path — there is only the one call shape now. State:
#   $tmp_dir/draft         "true" | "false" | "error" — same as confirm_pr_ready's
#   $tmp_dir/reviews       the reviews array, verbatim REST-shaped JSON (as above)
#   $tmp_dir/pending       the pending reviewers, one per line — `login` alone
#                          (type defaults to `User`), or `login<TAB>type` to

#   $tmp_dir/api-fail      the call number (1-based) from which every `api

# `confirm_pr_draft`/`confirm_pr_ready`/`confirm_review_requested`/
