# test/stage-budget.test.sh — the derivation that decides how long a stage is
# allowed (requirement 4f, lib/stage-budget.sh).
#
# Every number here is a pure function of the fleet log, so this file is a
# fixture and a set of expectations — no clock, no network, no model. The
# fixture dates are absolute for that reason: a derivation whose answers moved
# with the wall clock could not be asserted on at all.
#
# What is worth testing, and why each one fails silently otherwise:
#
#   the safe direction     Both mechanisms are chosen so that being wrong
#                          costs the marginal minutes of a doomed session
#                          rather than a finished stage. The watchdog widens
#                          on a censored observation and never narrows below
#                          its prior; the backstop jumps on a kill and creeps
#                          down only under three simultaneous conditions. Get
#                          either direction backwards and the mechanism still
#                          runs, still produces numbers, and quietly destroys
#                          work — which is exactly the failure it replaces.
#   the cell key           (actor, repository, model). Pool the models and a
#                          controller sees an average kill rate that is too
#                          tight for one and too loose for the other, and
#                          converges for neither. Nothing in the output looks
#                          wrong when that happens.
#   the cold start         A repository with no history must get a working
#                          answer on its first cycle, because a customer must
#                          never be asked to choose a timeout.
#   the censoring          A killed run contributes no duration. Its recorded
#                          length is its cap, and treating that as an
#                          observation is the death spiral this design exists
#                          to avoid.
#   degradation            A malformed log, an absent field, a stage from
#                          before any of this existed: all must yield a
#                          usable answer rather than an empty one, because the
#                          caller launches a stage with whatever comes back.
