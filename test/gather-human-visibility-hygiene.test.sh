# test/gather-human-visibility-hygiene.test.sh — regression test for
# scripts/gather-human-visibility-hygiene.sh (requirement 38e): turning a
# still-live human-visibility violation into an ordinary `human-visibility`
# candidate, or dropping one a live re-check shows has already resolved.
#
# The behaviours asserted, each failing silently if broken:
#
#   - **No violations handed in is `[]`.** The ordinary answer almost every
#     cycle gets — a repo with nothing recently logged against it.
#   - **A violation that still reproduces live becomes exactly one candidate**,
#     `source: "human-visibility"` (its own source, issue #284's decision 2 —
#     never `register-hygiene`), with its own `human-visibility-<hash>` ref.
#   - **The six warning classes are told apart (issue #284's decision 1).** A
#     `could not request review from …` violation clears only once a human
#     review is live or already given (`reviewRequests` non-empty, or a
#     non-bot review with state `APPROVED`/`CHANGES_REQUESTED` in the reviews
#     list — never `reviewDecision`, agent-ops#391, TD-PPagop-26081505); a
#     `could not read the pull request's reviews …` violation
#     (`_handoff_pr_approved`'s own read failing inside the idle-nudge check)
#     has no follow-up action outcome of its own to check — the read failing
#     was the whole violation — and since agent-ops#1085 moved that read onto
#     the same GraphQL surface (`_handoff_pr_query`) this function's own
#     `gh pr view` re-check already asks `reviews` from, reaching this class
#     at all past that call's own success is the answer: it drops
#     unconditionally, the one class with no live fact of its own left to
#     check; a
#     `could not read the pull request's state …` violation (the sweep's own
#     broad `gh pr view --json reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,
#     statusCheckRollup,reviews,comments` call failing — the read that gates
#     every downstream check the sweep makes for a pull request) is the same
#     shape: no follow-up action outcome to inspect, and the narrower `gh pr
#     view` re-check this function already opened with proves nothing about
#     it either (it omits `statusCheckRollup` entirely), so it re-runs the
#     sweep's own call verbatim and drops only once that succeeds again; a
#     `could not post the idle nudge comment` violation — logged only against
#     an already-`APPROVED` pull request — clears only once a comment carrying
#     both the exact `<!-- agent-ops:human-nudge -->` HTML-comment form and
#     the pipeline-marker stamp appears on the same comment, never merely
#     because the pull request is approved, and never from a comment carrying
#     only one of the two (agent-ops#390, #428). Using the request-class check
#     for both would silently drop every nudge-class warning on sight; this
#     confirms it does not. A `no legal review-request candidate` violation
#     (tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26081001.md) clears only once a non-author,
#     non-bot, submitted review appears, a review request is already pending
#     (CODEOWNERS' own auto-request, before anyone has reviewed), or the
#     assignee named in its own detail text no longer names the pull
#     request's author. A `could not post the merge-queue-dequeued notice`
#     violation (TD-PPagop-26081504) clears only once the
#     `agent-ops:merge-queue-dequeued:` marker comment actually appears, the
#     same marker-read shape as the nudge class, never the request class's
#     "has this been reviewed" check.
#   - **A pull-request violation of any class is dropped once merged, closed
#     or back in draft**, and a repo-level listing failure is dropped only
#     once the listing itself succeeds live.
#   - **An unreadable live re-check, or a genuinely unrecognised warning
#     shape (one none of the six classes above matches), keeps the
#     violation** — the same "never guess a read it could not make was
#     clean" reasoning `sweep-human-visibility.sh` itself uses.
#
# The script is run for real against a stubbed `gh`, so what is asserted is
# the shipped script rather than a copy of its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/gather-human-visibility-hygiene.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# --- A stub `gh`, answering only `pr list` and `pr view` -------------------
#
# `$STUB_LIST_RC` steers whether the repo-level listing re-check still fails
# (nonzero) or now succeeds (0, the default). `$STUB_PR_STATE`/`$STUB_PR_DRAFT`
# steer a named pull request's live open/draft state; `$STUB_REVIEW_REQUESTS`
# (nonzero means a pending request exists) and `$STUB_REVIEWS` (a JSON array
# of `{author:{login},state}`, default `[]`) together steer the
# request-class check — a non-bot `APPROVED`/`CHANGES_REQUESTED` entry in
# `$STUB_REVIEWS` clears it the same as a pending request does, read from the
# reviews list rather than `reviewDecision` (agent-ops#391,
# TD-PPagop-26081505); `$STUB_REVIEW_DECISION` is still emitted by the stub
# (mirroring `gh pr view`'s real payload) but the request-class check no
# longer reads it — tests below set it to confirm that. `$STUB_REVIEW_REQUESTS_JSON`,
# when set, overrides `$STUB_REVIEW_REQUESTS` with a literal `reviewRequests`
# array, for fixturing a Bot-typed/`[bot]`-suffixed or team-shaped entry
# (tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26081403.md); `$STUB_NUDGE_COMMENT` steers which
# nudge-related comment (if any) is present — `none` (default), `real` (the
# genuine shape, both the exact `<!-- agent-ops:human-nudge -->` form and the
# `PIPELINE_COMMENT_MARKER_PREFIX` stamp on the same comment), `prose` (the
# stamp, but only prose mentioning the marker, no exact HTML form —
# a Reviewer summarising a change to this check), `fenced` (the exact HTML
# form quoted in a fenced code block, with no stamp — a bystander write), or
# `prefixed-only` (the stamp on an ordinary pipeline comment carrying no
# nudge marker at all); `$STUB_DEQUEUE_MARKER` (`yes`/`no`) steers whether the
# merge-queue-dequeued marker comment is present instead. Both are served by
# the `api repos/o/a/issues/9/comments` branch below (the paginated REST read
# `could_not_post_nudge`/`dequeue_notice` now use, agent-ops#1858), not `pr
# view`: `$STUB_COMMENTS_RC` set nonzero fails that read; `$STUB_COMMENTS_PAGES`
# (default 1) prepends that many filler pages ahead of the real one, proving a
# marker on a later page of a paginated thread is still found. `$STUB_AUTHOR`
# (default `author`) and `$STUB_REVIEWS` also steer the no-candidate-class
# check; `$STUB_VIEW_RC` set nonzero makes the opening `pr view` re-check
# itself unreadable, the fail-safe case — including for the
# could_not_read_reviews class, whose own re-check this stub answers no
# differently from any other class since agent-ops#1085: that class's read
# (`_handoff_pr_approved`, via `_handoff_pr_query`) moved onto this same
# `pr view` call's own GraphQL surface, so there is no longer a second,
# separately-stubbable endpoint for it (see the script's own header for why
# that fold is now correct). `$STUB_STATE_VIEW_RC` (default 0) likewise
# steers the could_not_read_state class's own re-check — the sweep's broader
# `pr view --json …,statusCheckRollup,…` call, distinguished from the
# opening `pr view` re-check by that field's presence in argv, so a test can
# fail one while the other stays readable too.
