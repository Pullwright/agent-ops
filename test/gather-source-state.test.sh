# test/gather-source-state.test.sh — regression test for the argv cap
# (docs/spec/implementation/requirements, requirement 4g; TD-PPagop-26081503)
# in scripts/gather-source-state.sh's final state build, and for the issues
# and open-PR listings being paged to completion (requirement 3b) — the two
# samples requirement 34i's work-gone sweep reads *absence* from, so a
# one-page sample on a repo past the page size clears real blocks as
# "closed" (the 2026-09-04 false unblock of #874).
#
# `$issues`, `$workflows` and `$open_prs` each grow with the repo — one
# repo's whole open-issue list, workflow digest and open-PR list — and used
# to ride into the final `jq -nc` as three separate `--argjson` values. Past
# `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` (131072 bytes) the build dies at `execve`, `ok` is never
# flipped by the failed subshell (the header comment's own warning), and the
# Script would trust a digest built from a call that never ran.
#
# The gatherer is run for real here against a stubbed `gh`, with `$issues`
# fixtured past the cap, so what is asserted is the shipped build rather than
# a copy of its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/gather-source-state.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# --- A stub `gh`, so the real gatherer runs offline ---

# Mimics the two behaviours of `gh api --jq` the script depends on: string
# results print raw, not JSON (jq -rc reproduces that exactly), and — for an
# array endpoint — GitHub's own page semantics: one `per_page` slice without
# `--paginate`, every slice (the filter re-run once per page, outputs
# concatenated) with it. The page emulation is what makes the 1500-issue
# assertion below a real regression test: a gatherer that forgets
# `--paginate` sees only the first slice here, exactly as it would against
# GitHub, instead of the whole fixture by stub accident — which is how the
# truncation that requirement 34i turned into false "issue is closed"
# clearances stayed invisible to this suite. `$STUB_ISSUES` names a file
# holding the raw (unfiltered) issues-endpoint body, fixtured past the argv
# cap below; the other three endpoints stay small.
