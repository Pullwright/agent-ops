# test/abandoned-drafts.test.sh — regression test for the candidate rule of
# scripts/gather-abandoned-drafts.sh (requirement 3e) and the back-pressure
# narrowing it shares with review-feedback (requirement 2.2a).
#
# The rule decides which of *our own* draft PRs have been abandoned and are safe
# to finish, and it has two dangerous directions:
#   - too eager, and it steals a draft a peer node (or a human) is still working,
#     force-pushing over live work;
#   - too shy, and a genuinely stalled draft sits forever occupying a
#     back-pressure slot while every cycle looks healthy.
# The freshness gate is "last **real** activity older than the threshold"
# (TD26072605) — not GitHub's raw `updatedAt`, which also moves for a label edit
# or a comment the pipeline posted about itself, neither of which means anybody
# is on it. This is the half most easily broken by a careless edit — so it is
# asserted here, as jq over the same shapes the GitHub API returns, since the
# gatherer's `gh` calls aren't reachable from a unit test. Keep this in step with
# the filters in the script.
#
# Run directly:
#
#   ./test/abandoned-drafts.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# --- The candidate filter: which draft PRs are ours to finish? ---

# The shape the gatherer works on: what `gh pr list --json
# number,title,headRefName,headRefOid,isDraft,updatedAt,url,body,comments,reviews`
# returns (the `--label` filter is applied by gh, so every row here already
# carries pr_label), with `head_committed_at` annotated onto each row from the
# one REST call the gatherer makes per surviving candidate — `GET
# /repos/<slug>/commits/<headRefOid>`, read as `.commit.committer.date`.
#
# The listing no longer asks for the whole `commits` collection. It cost 31
# GraphQL points a call against a repository with three open pull requests —
# `gh` requests `commits(last: 100)` in each of the `--limit` slots and GitHub
# charges for nodes asked for, not returned — and that is how the fleet
# exhausted its hourly budget on 2026-08-12. The head sha now arrives as the
# scalar `headRefOid` for 1 point, and the head commit's date, which this
# computation needs and a sha alone does not give, comes from REST.
#
# `cutoff` is `now − stale-hours`; a PR is abandoned when its **last real
# activity** — not its raw `updatedAt` — is older than it.

# at the cap the PR is not judged at all, because a human's comment posted
# yesterday could be precisely the entry the cap cut off — and stealing that

# carrying 100 of anything waits for a human instead of being auto-finished.

# #92 is the same rule reached the other way. `commits` needed a cap check of

# commit rather than the head; `headRefOid` is the head at any branch length,
# so that clause is gone. What replaces it is the failure the REST head-commit
# fetch can have: an unreadable date, left as null. The guard is load-bearing —
# jq sorts null below every string, so without it #92's activity would be null,
# `null < $cutoff` would hold, and a draft a human pushed to minutes ago would
# be handed to an Implementer to force-push over.
