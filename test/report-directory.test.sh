# test/report-directory.test.sh — regression test for lib/report-directory.sh
# (issue #761): resolving a configurable `report_directory` — a GNU date(1)
# format string — into today's write path, and discovering which of its past
# instances already exist on a repository's default branch.
#
# Behaviours asserted:
#
#   - `report_directory_regex` turns a format string into an ERE matching any
#     string `date` could produce from it, escaping literal regex
#     metacharacters (including a literal backslash) and degrading an
#     unrecognised specifier to a wildcard rather than failing.
#   - `report_directory_find_dirs` discovers existing directories matching a
#     format's shape: the common case (the whole dynamic part is the format's
#     final segment, as the shipped default and every example in the issue
#     are shaped) costs exactly one directory listing; a format with a
#     dynamic segment in the middle and a static leaf after it still
#     resolves, at the cost of one further listing per level.
#   - `report_directory_most_recent` finds the latest existing instance and
#     its own date, and prints nothing when none exist within the lookback
#     window.
#   - A listing that fails for a reason other than the queried path not
#     existing (issue #1024) is signalled through `report_directory_find_dirs`'s
#     and `report_directory_most_recent`'s own exit status — distinct from a
#     genuinely empty listing (nothing matched, or a clean 404), which exits 0
#     printing nothing, the same as before this distinction existed.
#
# `gh` is stubbed the same shape test/gather-project-review.test.sh uses.
# Fixture dates are computed relative to the real clock at run time (10/20/45
# days ago), never hardcoded to a calendar year, because
# report_directory_most_recent's own search runs backward from today — a
# fixture pinned to "2026" would go stale (silently start failing) the day
# that year is more than the default 400-day lookback in the past.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/report-directory.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
