# test/human-reviewer-handoff-wiring.test.sh — regression test for the two
# blocks in agent-cycle.sh that read `handoff_complete_review`'s
# (lib/handoff.sh) `rereview`/`human_reviewer` fields at requirement 38's
# handoff: the Reviewer's own handoff, and the Enabler's `complete_handoff`
# recovery path.
#
# Before agent-ops#440, both blocks called `confirm_review_requested` and
# `ensure_human_reviewer` directly, and this file stubbed those two functions
# to pin the wiring. Both calls now happen inside `handoff_complete_review`
# itself, shared by both paths — test/handoff.test.sh covers that
# composition (including the two `failed` shapes `confirm_review_requested`/
# `ensure_human_reviewer` can return, and the precondition that `human_
# reviewer` is only ever asked when `rereview.state == "none"`). What this
# file still owns is the thinner question once removed: given each shape
# `handoff_complete_review`'s `rereview`/`human_reviewer` fields can take,
# does agent-cycle.sh's own block turn that into the right warning and the
# right `pr-ready` event? Both call sites read the same two fields off their
# own `review_json`/`e_review_json`, so this file seeds that JSON directly
# rather than the functions underneath it (tech-debt/TD-PPagop-26081402.md's
# defect — a raw return value matched against the literal string `failed`,
# which only ever equals the bare shape — is asserted the same way: for
# both the bare `failed` and the `failed<TAB><logins>` shape).
#
#   - **Either `failed` shape produces the warning** — bare and `failed<TAB>
#     <logins>` alike — naming the pull request and, when GitHub says who was
#     actually attempted, those logins rather than always falling back to
#     `enabler_assignee`.
#   - **`pr-ready` carries the bare state**, never `state<TAB>logins`, in
#     `human_review_requested`.
#   - **A `skip` (bare, or `skip<TAB>no-candidate`) omits `human_review_
#     requested` from `pr-ready` entirely** — the case the `startswith("skip")`
#     comparison this file's predecessor replaced was working around.
#   - **A live `requested` reaches `pr-ready` untouched**, so the fix does not
#     regress the ordinary path.
#
# Both blocks are lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the same way
# test/human-visibility-wiring.test.sh and test/closing-keyword-wiring.test.sh
# lift theirs, so the assertions are about the shipped code rather than a copy
# of its logic. Their only callee is `log_event`.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/human-reviewer-handoff-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
