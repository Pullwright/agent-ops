# shellcheck disable=SC2016,SC2034
# SC2016: the fixed-string boundaries `extract` matches against are jq/bash
# source text, deliberately single-quoted so nothing in them expands here.
# SC2034: every variable set before `eval "$reviewer_block"`/`"$enabler_block"`
# is read only by that eval'd body, not visible to shellcheck the way
# lib/merge-observed.sh's own header already explains for the same shape.

# test/checks-green-join-key.test.sh — regression test for the item-lifecycle
# record's own "checks green" instant (requirement 49, issue #595) and the
# join key added alongside it to `review-gate-checks-read`, at both of the
# two call sites that share `handoff_complete_review`'s gate: the Reviewer's
# own handoff (agent-cycle.sh) and the Enabler's `complete_handoff` recovery
# path (lib/enabler.sh).
#
# Both snippets are lifted verbatim, the same technique
# test/landing-wiring.test.sh and its siblings use, so the assertions are
# about the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic. Each is a compact,
# self-contained pair of statements needing nothing beyond
# `$gate_word`/`$gate_checks_unreadable` (or their `e_` equivalents),
# `$selected_repo`/`$selected_item` (or `$e_repo`/`$e_item`), and `log_event`.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/checks-green-join-key.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
