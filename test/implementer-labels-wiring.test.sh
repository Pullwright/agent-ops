# test/implementer-labels-wiring.test.sh — regression test for the block in
# agent-cycle.sh that turns the Implementer summary's optional `labels` field
# into a `labels_mint` call and a `labels-minted` event (requirements 26b/6c,
# issue #714) — the Implementer's own half of "labels a stage asks for";
# test/refiner-verdicts.test.sh covers the Refiner's.
#
# Lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh with awk, the same way
# test/closing-keyword-wiring.test.sh lifts its own block, so this cannot pass
# against a copy the script has since moved on from. Its callees —
# `labels_mint`, `labels_reserved_names`, `log_event` — are stubbed: each has
# (or belongs to) its own test elsewhere (test/labels.test.sh), wiring the
# real ones in here would make this file a second copy of that one, coupled
# to its internals for no assertion this file makes.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/implementer-labels-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# `if [[ -n "$impl_pr_url" ]]` this block lives inside, whose own closing `fi`
# sits at column 0 and is deliberately left out: this block is self-contained
