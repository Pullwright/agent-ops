# test/rotate-logs.test.sh — regression test for scripts/rotate-logs.sh
# (TD26072501, requirement 2.6).
#
# What matters here:
#
#   what rotates      dashboard.log, state-sync.log, doctor.log,
#                     revert-rate.log, tech-debt-archive.log, cron.log,
#                     review-cron.log and gh-shim/ledger.ndjson (requirement
#                     2.0e), and only once they cross the threshold — a log
#                     still under it is left byte-identical.
#   what never does   log.jsonl, review-log.jsonl and revert-rate.jsonl are
#                     the fleet's memory (the union readers scan them whole);
#                     no size, however large, may rotate them. Since
#                     requirement 2.6d this is a stated retention policy
#                     (`analytics_retained_days`), not merely an omission
#                     from the LOGS array below — the array's own exclusion
#                     of these three names is a consequence of that policy,
#                     and the shipped config's own default (`0`, retain
#                     indefinitely) is asserted here alongside the
#                     behavioural proof that the exclusion actually holds.
#   how generations   a rotation renames the live file to `.1`; a second
#   stack             rotation shifts a stale `.1` to `.2` rather than
#                     clobbering it, and a generation beyond
#                     `log_generations` is dropped, never silently kept
#                     forever.
#   the live file      a fresh, empty file replaces the rotated one
#   never goes missing immediately, so a reader between rotation and the
#                     next append sees an empty file, never a missing one.
#   the one-off        `once-pr4-verify.log` is removed if present, and its
#                     absence is not an error.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/rotate-logs.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
