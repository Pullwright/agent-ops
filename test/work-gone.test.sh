# test/work-gone.test.sh — regression test for requirement 34i: the blocks whose
# work no longer exists, and the register, review and plan reads that decide
# three of the five classes.
#
# Both halves are asserted from both sides, because the two failure directions
# are not alike and only one of them is loud:
#
#   - **Too eager** clears a block out from under work that is still real. The
#     item goes back in the candidate pool, a Co-Ordinator selects it, an
#     Implementer runs, and it re-blocks — a full cycle spent to arrive where it
#     started, cycle after cycle, for as long as the mistake stands. So every "unknown"
#     shape is asserted to clear nothing: a repo missing from the digest, a repo
#     whose digest says `ok: false`, an id no register file claims, an id two of
#     them claim, a review ref no merged pull request names, a plan id no
#     task-list line names (or that two of them do), and every class the rule
#     does not cover at all.
#   - **Too shy** is the defect this requirement exists to fix and is silent: the
#     item stays on the dashboard as blocked and the Enabler pays for a full
#     re-examination to learn what a `gh` read already on disk would have said.
#     So the positives are asserted just as hard — the closed issue, the merged
#     pull request, the resolved and `not-debt` register entries, the legacy id
#     that names an item whose file has since been renamed, the project-review
#     recommendation a merged pull request names, and the implementation-plan
#     task checked off in its document.
#
# `scripts/gather-register-status.sh`, `scripts/gather-review-status.sh` and
# `scripts/gather-plan-status.sh` are each run for real against a stubbed `gh`
# reproducing the relevant API's own shapes, so what is asserted is the shipped
# scripts rather than a copy of their logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/work-gone.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
