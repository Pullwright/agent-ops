# test/closing-keyword-wiring.test.sh — regression test for the two blocks in
# agent-cycle.sh that decide what requirement 25a's script-side gate
# (lib/closing-keyword-gate.sh) actually *does* with its verdict at the
# Implementer→Reviewer handoff.
#
# test/closing-keyword-gate.test.sh covers the gate's own verdict, and
# test/check-closing-keyword.test.sh the rule underneath it. Both pass with the
# consequence wired either way round, and the consequence is the whole
# question this file exists for:
#
#   - **A `dirty` verdict here is feedback, not a refusal.** What the gate
#     finds is a pull-request *body* edit, the class of defect the Reviewer's
#     own step 4 fixes and pushes in the same cycle. Refusing the handoff
#     would record the item `attempt-failed` and block it pending an Enabler
#     engagement — a self-healing case turned into a stuck one — and buy no
#     safety, since the same gate is asked again at the Reviewer's `ready`
#     handoff, which is the only way a pull request reaches a human or a
#     merge. So the block must set the finding and *carry on*; the shipped
#     first cut of this gate exited here instead.
#   - **The finding has to actually reach the Reviewer.** It cannot see the
#     later gate's verdict from inside its own session, so a finding recorded
#     in the log and left out of the prompt is a review that hands off and is
#     handed back — the review spent and the item lost anyway. The prompt
#     section is therefore asserted, in both directions: present and naming
#     the fault when there is one, and wholly absent (not an empty heading)
#     when there is not.
#   - **`unknown` is neither.** A `gh` that could not answer says something
#     about this node, not this pull request; it warns, and nothing is handed
#     to the Reviewer to "fix".
#
# Both blocks are lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the same way
# test/human-visibility-wiring.test.sh lifts its block, so the assertions are
# about the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic. Their callees are
# stubbed: `closing_keyword_gate` (covered by its own test), `log_event`,
# `release_claim` and `stage_prompt_text`.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/closing-keyword-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
