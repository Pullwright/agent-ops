# test/pager-invariants.test.sh — the invariants lib/pager-invariants.sh
# ships with: agent-ops#1278's `verdict-unanimous` (fixture heartbeat sets)
# and `page-outlived-item` (a stubbed `gh`); agent-ops#1282's five
# peer-vantage invariants; agent-ops#1281's seven selection/ledger
# invariants (idle-with-demand, fit-ladder-pinned, work-order-repaired-rate,
# blocked-label-orphaned, claim-unreconciled, escalation-burst,
# digest-truncated).
#
# lib/pager.sh's own registry/state-machine/remedy-class behaviour is
# test/pager.test.sh's job; this file calls each invariant's EVAL_FN and
# remedy function directly rather than through pager_evaluate, since what
# it is proving is what fires and what the remedy actually does — not the
# claim/hysteresis/event-sourcing machinery around it.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run it
# directly:
#
#   ./test/pager-invariants.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
