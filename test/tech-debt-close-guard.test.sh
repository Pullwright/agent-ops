# test/tech-debt-close-guard.test.sh — regression tests for
# scripts/tech-debt-close-guard.sh (issue #877): the advisory check that a
# closed `pw::type:tech-debt` issue carries some evidence of its resolution.
#
# Behaviours asserted:
#
#   - **An issue with no `pw::type:tech-debt` label is skipped entirely** —
#     `gh` is never even called.
#   - **A `completed` close with a linked closing pull request or commit
#     (the issue's own timeline `closer`) needs nothing else** — no comment.
#   - **A `completed` close with no linked closer but a real comment already
#     on the issue needs nothing else** — no comment.
#   - **A `completed` close with neither draws exactly one guard comment.**
#   - **A `not_planned` close with a comment already present needs nothing
#     else**; with none, draws exactly one guard comment.
#   - **A `duplicate` close follows that same comment rule, never the
#     `completed` one** — it asks GitHub nothing about a closing pull request,
#     because a duplicate close cannot have one, and its comment names the
#     duplicate rather than reporting a completed close.
#   - **An empty/unset `state_reason` follows the `completed` rule** — GitHub's
#     own default — while an unknown one is named verbatim rather than
#     re-reported as `completed`.
#   - **The guard's own past comments never count as "a comment already
#     present"** — otherwise the first guarded close would silently satisfy
#     every later one.
#   - **A guard comment already posted for this exact close (same
#     `closed_at` marker) is not posted twice**; a *different* `closed_at`
#     (a later close of the same issue) is judged fresh.
#   - **A failed comments fetch draws a `warning`, not a comment** — a
#     transient `gh`/API failure is never read as "no comments" (issue #1240).
#   - **Malformed arguments exit 2 without calling `gh`.**
#
# `gh` is stubbed through GH, matching the technique
# test/release-pending-reservations.test.sh's stub uses for its own `gh api`
# calls.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run it
# directly:
#
#   ./test/tech-debt-close-guard.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
