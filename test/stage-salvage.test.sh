# test/stage-salvage.test.sh — the bounded salvage resume of issue #237:
# before an engagement whose final message failed extract_json_result is
# discarded, the runner asks the *same* session, once, for nothing but the
# verdict object.
#
# What this guards: a stage that ends with a background task still pending
# ("I'll check back shortly") or any other shape extract_json_result cannot
# parse used to be discarded whole — the work it already did, gone, and its
# claims frozen behind it. stage_salvage_result (agent-cycle.sh) is the
# recovery: resume the same `claude` session named by the original run's
# `session_id` with a minimal continuation prompt, and re-parse. These cases
# pin that it recovers a verdict the resume produces, refuses to fabricate
# one the resume still doesn't, and never spends a resume on a run that left
# no session behind at all.
#
# `claude` is a stub on PATH — no network, no model, no cost. The function
# under test is lifted from agent-cycle.sh itself (as
# test/extract-json-result.test.sh already does), so this cannot pass against
# a copy the script has since moved on from.
#
# Run directly: ./test/stage-salvage.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
