#
# test/stage-stream.test.sh — a stage streams as it runs, and still leaves the
# envelope every reader downstream of it expects (requirement 4d).
#
# What this guards, and why it is two properties rather than one:
#
#   the stream grows while the stage is still running
#     This is the whole reason for `--output-format stream-json --verbose`.
#     The non-streaming form writes one object at the very end, so a stage
#     killed at its cap left an empty file and nothing at all was known about
#     how far it had got — the shape of every timeout in this repository's
#     history. If a runtime ever buffers the stage's stdout when it is not a
#     tty, the file stops growing until the run ends and every use of the
#     stream silently becomes a use of nothing; asserting on growth *during*
#     the run is what catches that, and asserting on the finished file would
#     not.
#
#   `<stage>.out` is unchanged
#     Nothing downstream reads the stream: the result parsers, the per-stage
#     metering record (requirement 33a), limit detection and the dashboard all
#     read `<stage>.out`, and they read it exactly as they did before the
#     switch because `run_model_stage` truncates the stream to its final
#     `result` event. `metering_fields` is run against both here — the
#     truncated line and a bare non-streaming envelope carrying the same
#     numbers — and asserted to derive the identical record, because "the
#     migration changed nothing" is a claim about that record and not about
#     the file it came from.
#
# The degradations matter as much as the happy path, because a killed stage is
# a normal event here and its stream ends mid-line: a torn tail must still
# yield an earlier `result` event, and a stream with no `result` event at all
# must leave `.out` empty rather than corrupt — empty is what every reader
# already treats as "this stage produced no envelope".
#
# `claude` is a stub on PATH that emits canned NDJSON with pauses between
# lines — no network, no model, no cost.
#
# Run directly: ./test/stage-stream.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
