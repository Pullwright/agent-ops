# test/item-lifecycle.test.sh — self-contained regression test for
# lib/item-lifecycle.sh (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md's "Item lifecycle record",
# requirement 49 of docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md, issue #595). Also
# covers requirement 2.6d's de-duplication property (agent-ops#598), which
# this fold is the worked example for.
#
# What matters here:
#
#   one fixture per     landed, voided, superseded, abandoned, blocked, open
#   terminal fate       — each item resolvable from exactly one rule, per
#                        lib/item-lifecycle.sh's own documented priority.
#   the invariant       every entered item lands in exactly one of the seven
#   balances            buckets (six fates plus unaccounted); `totals.balanced`
#                        is asserted true on a fixture carrying all of them at
#                        once.
#   unaccounted         a voided-after-landed contradiction is not silently
#                        resolved either way — it is named, with its reason,
#                        and still counted (never dropped).
#   reworked_after_      additive alongside fate: "landed" — present, naming
#   landed               the earliest later item-scoped event, when one
#                        exists; absent (never false/null) otherwise.
#   degradation         a malformed line, a missing field, an event naming
#                        no item, and a non-string `repo` all yield a
#                        conforming report rather than aborting the fold.
#   two-node dedup       two nodes each folding the union `fleet_logs` hands
#                        them (their own log plus the other's, as a peer)
#                        produce byte-identical `records[]`, and merging
#                        both folds' records by `{repo, item}` still yields
#                        exactly one record per item (requirement 2.6d).
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/item-lifecycle.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
