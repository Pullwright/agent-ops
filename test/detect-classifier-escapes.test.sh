# test/detect-classifier-escapes.test.sh — regression test for
# scripts/detect-classifier-escapes.sh (D18 Stage 2 exit criterion "zero
# classifier escapes"; agent-ops#572): the independent, post-hoc classifier-
# escape detector.
#
# Two halves:
#
#   - The reimplemented protected-path matching, protected-path resolution,
#     routine-sources resolution and routine-complexity resolution
#     (`_escape_audit_is_protected`/`_escape_audit_protected_paths`/
#     `_escape_audit_routine_sources`/`_escape_audit_routine_complexity`,
#     lifted verbatim out of the script the same way
#     test/landing-retry-sweep.test.sh lifts `_landing_retry_sweep_repo` out
#     of agent-cycle.sh) are pinned byte-for-byte identical to
#     lib/landing.sh's own `_landing_is_protected`/`_landing_protected_paths`/
#     `_landing_routine_sources`/`_landing_routine_complexity`, over the same
#     battery of inputs — so the two can drift apart in the same PR without it
#     drifting *silently*, even though the detector deliberately never sources
#     lib/landing.sh at all (the issue's own Refiner comment: "read there for
#     the exact logic this detector must reproduce independently (not call
#     into)"). Both protected-path fallbacks are additionally pinned to
#     config.schema.json's own declared `merge_autonomy_protected_paths`
#     default, because that — not the two literals against each other — is
#     the pair production actually rests on: lib/landing.sh is called with
#     `$DEFAULTED_CONFIG` and takes the top-level branch, while the detector
#     is handed the raw `--config` file and takes its own literal. The
#     routine-sources fallbacks get the same schema-default pin, plus
#     scripts/doctor.sh's own two hand-copied literals (extracted from the
#     script text, since neither is a standalone function this file can lift
#     and eval) — closing the same gap for `merge_autonomy_routine_sources`
#     that its sibling key already had.
#   - The script itself, invoked as a subprocess against a stubbed `gh`
#     (PATH-prepended, the same technique test/mine-merge-history.test.sh
#     uses): a merged pull request whose merge commit touches a protected
#     path is an injected known escape, and must be caught, as are the other
#     three ways recomputation can disagree with a landing that happened — a
#     complexity outside the repository's routine-complexity list (default
#     `low`/`medium`; D18 Stage 3, agent-ops#725), a source outside the
#     repository's routine list, and an effective `merge_autonomy` level
#     recorded at arming that sits below `agent-merges-routine`; one whose
#     four inputs all agree is clean;
#     each of the ways an input can fail to reconstruct is unverifiable,
#     never clean; a pull request merged by anyone other than the passed-in
#     Approver login is not audited at all; and a pull request already
#     carrying an audit event in the log is skipped before any `gh` call is
#     spent on it at all, verified against the stub's own call log rather
#     than only the detector's output. The stub also refuses any
#     parameterised call that does not say
#     `--method GET`, because the real `gh api` would POST it — see its own
#     note below.
#
# Run directly:
#
#   ./test/detect-classifier-escapes.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
