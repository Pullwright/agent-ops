# test/review-not-before.test.sh — `repository_review.defaults.not_before` holds the review
# pipeline off until a date, and nothing else off at all.
#
# The requirement it serves (R3.3) is one the switch cannot express. `--disable`
# is deliberately shared between both pipelines, so using it to hold a review
# back would stop the implementation cycles for the same window — and the case
# this exists for is precisely "no reviews until Thursday, but keep working".
#
# Six behaviours, and the middle four are the ones that would fail quietly:
#
#   in force      a timestamp in the future stands the review down, and says so
#                 in the log with the date attached, so an operator reading
#                 `review-stand-down` can tell this apart from a switch
#   expired       a timestamp in the past is inert — the whole point of a
#                 timestamp over a raised `min_days_between_reviews` is that it
#                 needs no undoing, and a stand-down that outlived its date
#                 would be the throttle-left-on failure wearing a new hat
#   absent        no key, or an empty one, is not a stand-down. The key is
#                 optional and most nodes will never set it
#   unparseable   stands down rather than running. The operator plainly meant
#                 to hold reviews off; running through a value we could not
#                 read would spend exactly the quota they were protecting
#   tier two      `repository_review.defaults.not_before` is only the
#                 installation-wide half (requirement 342); when it is itself
#                 unset but every configured repository's own override still
#                 holds it off, the whole cycle stands down before the lock
#                 too, rather than taking it for a run R4's skip-guard would
#                 skip every repository of anyway
#   mixed         and the converse: one repository held on its own override
#                 while another is free stands *neither* tier down — the cycle
#                 runs, and R4's per-repository skip-guard turns the held one
#                 away by name. A `not_before` that only ever ran cycle-wide
#                 passes every case above and fails this one alone
#
# Each case runs the real `review-cycle.sh` against a shim node: a directory of
# symlinks back into the tree with its own `config.json`, which works because
# the script takes SCRIPT_DIR from its own path and reads config from there.
# `repository_review.repos` is emptied so a run that is *not* stood down still finishes
# without reaching for the network — except the last two cases, which need real
# entries to exercise the per-repository resolution: the tier-two case relies on
# the stand-down itself firing before any repository is touched, and the mixed
# case, which by design gets past it, on the fail-fast shims described below.
#
# No network. Run directly: ./test/review-not-before.test.sh — exit 0 iff all
# passed.
