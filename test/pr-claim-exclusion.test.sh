# test/pr-claim-exclusion.test.sh — regression tests for issue #238's two
# deterministic-code pieces of PR-level claim exclusion, both lifted whole out
# of agent-cycle.sh rather than reimplemented, so a change to the real
# function is what this suite exercises:
#
#   - gather_claimed: the PR-keyed claim's pr_number rides the dedup along
#     with the item-keyed claim's, so a peer's claim on the same PR under a
#     different item ref is visible without an extra lookup.
#   - exclude_claimed_prs: the finishing sources' own candidate arrays are
#     filtered by that pr_number before they ever reach the Co-Ordinator —
#     deterministic code, not a comparison the model has to remember to make
#     per candidate (the failure mode that let PR #205 be worked by three
#     nodes at once: a Co-Ordinator "saw" a peer's claim and reasoned past it
#     because the item ref didn't match).
#
# Requirement 3q extends the same decision from PR numbers to item refs, and
# requirement 17a applies it again on the claim side, so this suite also
# covers:
#
#   - exclude_claimed_items: every pre-fetched source's array is filtered by
#     claimed item ref before the Co-Ordinator sees it (the failure mode of
#     2026-08-09: a Co-Ordinator read four issues as claimed and ranked
#     three of them as alternates anyway).
#   - candidate_preclaimed: the claim loop's own pre-claim check — a
#     candidate the cycle's gather already saw claimed is skipped without
#     spending a claim attempt on a foregone conclusion.
#
# test/claim.test.sh covers the underlying claim primitive (two item refs on
# one PR, only one PR-level claim survives); test/enabler-eligibility.test.sh
# covers enabler_eligible_items itself. This is the third leg: the Script's
# own filtering code around both.
#
# No network and no GitHub beyond the same filesystem-CAS gh stub
# test/claim.test.sh uses. Run directly:
#
#   ./test/pr-claim-exclusion.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
