# test/backpressure-decision.test.sh — regression test for requirement 2.2a's
# decision-site fold-in (agent-ops#459).
#
# Requirement 2.2a's own comment claims a conflicted or dequeued PR already
# holds a slot requirement 2.2's count counts. It does not: 2.2's count is
# taken before this cycle's merge-conflict and dequeued candidates are
# gathered, and neither gatherer's candidate rule reads `reviewDecision` at
# all (scripts/gather-merge-conflicts.sh, scripts/gather-dequeued.sh) — so
# such a PR passes through 2.2's count exactly like an ordinary human-queue
# PR unless it happens to also carry CHANGES_REQUESTED, which for a dequeued
# PR (only reachable after approval) is essentially never. The decision-site
# fold-in folds back in whatever `counted_prs_json` — 2.2's own record of
# which PRs its count held — does not already hold, before the trip is
# (re-)evaluated.
#
# This is not test/backpressure-wiring.test.sh's block: that one covers 2.2's
# own four-part sum. This one covers what happens next, at the decision site
# — a distinct seam with its own way to go wrong: silently under-counting a
# slot a human cannot clear, which opens a gate whose whole purpose is to
# stay shut.
#
# Lifted verbatim out of lib/gather-phase.sh (agent-cycle.sh's own body until
# issue #1958), the same way test/backpressure-wiring.test.sh lifts its own
# block, so the assertions are about the shipped code rather than a copy of
# its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly: ./test/backpressure-decision.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
