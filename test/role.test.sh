# test/role.test.sh — regression test for lib/role.sh and the role guard in
# both pipeline entry points.
#
# The guard has one job (stop a node that is not the active one from spending)
# and one way to fail badly: to resolve toward "active" when it shouldn't. That
# failure is not silent — it opens duplicate pull requests and pays for them —
# but it is only visible after the money is gone, so the assertions below are
# mostly about the fail-closed direction: every value that is not exactly
# `active` must stand the node down, and a standby tick must leave no trace in
# state_dir for the next snapshot restore to disagree with.
#
# The two end-to-end cases drive the real scripts with a stubbed `claude` and a
# throwaway HOME, because the guard's placement (before the config is read,
# after the flags are parsed) is as much the requirement as its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/role.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
