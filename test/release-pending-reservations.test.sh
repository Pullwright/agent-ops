# test/release-pending-reservations.test.sh — regression tests for
# scripts/release-pending-reservations.sh (TD-PPagop-26082427): the retry
# pass for a tech-debt reservation release lib/tech-debt-file.sh's
# `_techdebt_unfile` could not make land the first time.
#
# Behaviours asserted:
#
#   - **A marker whose branch delete now succeeds is reported "released"**,
#     and its own marker file is cleared from the state repository.
#   - **A marker whose branch is already gone (a peer's concurrent retry, or
#     a delete by hand) reports "absent"**, not an
#     error, and is cleared the same way.
#   - **A marker whose delete fails again reports "warning"**, and is left in
#     place — checked by asserting no DELETE of the marker file itself is
#     attempted.
#   - **A malformed marker (missing repo or branch) reports "warning"** and is
#     left in place rather than acted on.
#   - **No `state_repo` configured is a silent no-op** — no `gh` call at all.
#   - **An empty `reservation-releases/` tree is a silent no-op.**
#   - **One invocation covers markers naming different target repositories**,
#     each independently.
#
# `gh` is stubbed through RELEASE_PENDING_GH, the technique
# test/sweep-orphan-branches.test.sh's own SWEEP_GH already uses to bypass
# lib/github-limit.sh's rate-limit wrapper in tests.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run it
# directly:
#
#   ./test/release-pending-reservations.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
