# test/finish-then-continue.test.sh — the chain-spawn half of finish-then-
# continue (requirement 39): once lib/chain.sh (test/chain.test.sh) says a
# cycle should chain, does agent-cycle.sh's cleanup() actually launch the next
# one, only when it should, and without ever waiting on it?
#
# The block under test is lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the same way
# test/signal-exit.test.sh lifts the signal handler: extracted rather than
# restated, so this cannot pass against a copy the script has since moved on
# from. Assembled around it are recording stubs for `log_event` and a fake
# `agent-cycle.sh` that records how it was invoked and exits immediately — no
# real cycle ever runs.
#
# What matters, in both directions: a chain-eligible, exit-0 cycle launches
# exactly one child, with the incremented chain count and the original argv,
# detached — the parent must not block on it. `chain_eligible` alone is not
# a safe gate: every ordinary ending after a won claim — blocked, void,
# complete, a handled stage failure (handle_stage_failure) — exits 0 just
# like a stand-down does, by design, so those *do* still chain (a failed
# item must not stall the fleet from picking up a different one sooner).
# What must never chain is a cycle that did not end cleanly at all: an
# untrapped error under `set -e`, or a signal's 128+n. That is what the
# `exit_code == 0` half of the gate actually guards, and the cases below
# check exactly that boundary.
#
# The extracted block also carries the image-behind check ahead of the chain
# decision (requirement 39, agent-ops#1096): a section further down drives it
# with the real `chain_image_behind`/`chain_write_roll_pending` (lib/chain.sh,
# test/chain.test.sh already covers those two in isolation) and a stubbed
# `image_drift_status`/`agent_ops_version`, checking that this new check only
# ever *cancels* an otherwise-eligible chain — never grants one — and writes
# `roll-pending.json` exactly when, and only when, it does.
#
# Run directly: ./test/finish-then-continue.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
