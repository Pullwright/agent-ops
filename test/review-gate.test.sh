# test/review-gate.test.sh — regression test for lib/review-gate.sh
# (requirement 31c, agent-ops#249).
#
# poetic-fiddle #216 reached `reviewDecision: APPROVED` with a CodeQL
# high-severity alert open, hidden inside an otherwise 15/16-green check
# list. The assertions below are the two facts that must hold before a pull
# request is handed to a human as ready, checked against a stubbed `gh`
# rather than trusted from a model's report:
#
#   - every required check green, with a pull request reporting no required
#     checks treated as a failure rather than a vacuous pass (poetic-fiddle
#     #190: a CONFLICTING pull request reports none at all) — and a
#     required-check list that could not be read at all (a 502, a transient
#     auth failure, a rate limit) reads as `unknown` rather than folded into
#     the same `dirty`, but still refuses the handoff (non-zero exit) exactly
#     like a genuine failure does (TD-PPagop-26081305): a fact about this node
#     or GitHub's availability, not the pull request, but not evidence of
#     "nothing wrong" either. The two arrive from `gh` in the *same* shape —
#     empty stdout, non-zero exit, since `gh` reports an empty required-check
#     list as an error and never as `[]` — so the stub below reproduces both
#     diagnoses verbatim and the assertions pin which word each earns;
#   - no code-scanning alert with a security severity introduced by the pull
#     request — one already open on the base branch is inherited debt, not
#     this pull request's fault, and must not block it;
#   - an alerts API that cannot be asked at all reads as `unknown` too, but
#     unlike the required-checks `unknown` above, it exits 0 and does not
#     itself block — a fact about the node or the repository, not the pull
#     request, that a caller must still be told about but need not refuse the
#     handoff over;
#   - an empty alert list is only believed once an analysis is confirmed to
#     exist for the merge ref (agent-ops#270) — the alerts endpoint answers a
#     never-analysed ref with `[]` and a 200, the same shape as a genuinely
#     clean pull request.
#
# `gh` is stubbed through REVIEW_GATE_GH, the same convention
# test/handoff.test.sh's stub uses.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/review-gate.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# --- The stub gh --------------------------------------------------------------
# State lives in files:
#   $tmp_dir/required.json   the `pr checks --required --json name,bucket`
#                             payload. Two sentinels stand for the two ways
#                             the real `gh` fails this call, both with empty
#                             stdout and a non-zero exit and distinguishable
#                             only by the diagnosis on stderr: "NONE" is
#                             #190's — `gh` reports a pull request with no
#                             required checks as an error, never as `[]`, so
#                             this is what the trap actually looks like — and
#                             "ERROR" is a transport failure (a 502, an auth
#                             failure, a rate limit) with `gh`'s own wording
#                             for one.
#   $tmp_dir/pr-alerts.tsv   lines for the `ref=refs/pull/<n>/merge` alerts
#                             call; "ERROR" makes the call fail.
#   $tmp_dir/base-alerts.tsv the same, for `ref=refs/heads/<default-branch>`.
#   $tmp_dir/analyses.count  what the code-scanning *analyses* listing answers
#                             (the lib asks it with `--jq length`, so this is
#                             the bare count); "ERROR" makes the call fail.
#                             This is the existence check that tells an empty
#                             alert list apart from a ref that was never
#                             analysed (agent-ops#270).
#   $tmp_dir/refs-asked      every ref the stub was asked for, one per line, so
#                             an assertion can pin *which* ref the alerts read
#                             uses rather than only what it does with the
#                             answer. A pull request's alerts exist only under
#                             `refs/pull/<n>/merge`; asking `.../head` returns
#                             an empty list and a 200, which reads as "clean"
#                             and would silently disarm the whole gate, so the
#                             stub answers only the merge ref and any other
#                             pull-request ref fails the call outright.
#   $tmp_dir/rules-branches.json  the `repos/<slug>/rules/branches/<base>`
#                             payload the issue #1543 backstop reads — the
#                             array of active rules GitHub reports for a
#                             branch, one `required_status_checks` rule among
#                             them; "ERROR" makes the call fail (a fact about
#                             this node or GitHub, not the pull request, so
#                             the backstop must skip rather than block).

# --- review_gate_unknown_streak_verdict -----------------------------------
# TD-PPagop-26081404: a node whose required-checks read keeps coming back
# `unknown` earns one escalation, not one node-level `warning` per item — see
# this function's own header for why it reuses `lib/crash-loop.sh`'s
# consecutive-run-resets-on-success shape rather than calling into it
# directly (that one counts fleet-wide; this one must not let a peer's
# success reset a node's own streak). No `gh` involved: it is a pure reader
# of the `review-gate-checks-read` bookkeeping event agent-cycle.sh logs on
# every ready-gate evaluation, so no stub is needed here.
