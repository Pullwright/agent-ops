# test/toggle.test.sh — regression test for lib/toggle.sh.
#
# The switch has one job (stop cycles starting) and one way to fail badly: to
# resolve toward "enabled" when it shouldn't, or to stay "disabled" when
# nothing will ever clear it. Both are silent. The assertions below are almost
# all about those two directions rather than about the happy path:
#
#   - an unreadable or half-written record must read as disabled, not enabled;
#   - an unparseable `expires_at` must not expire;
#   - a TTL typo must be an error, not a guess in either direction;
#   - `--enable` on an already-enabled pipeline is a normal outcome and must
#     not return non-zero, because every call site is `x="$(toggle_clear …)"`
#     under `set -e` (the trap in the Gotchas table).
#
# The offline e2e section below also covers `agent-cycle.sh --kill-merge-
# autonomy`/`--restore-merge-autonomy` (D18, requirement 2.3b): a third fleet
# flag built on this file's own `fleet_flag_*` machinery, exercised here
# rather than in test/merge-autonomy.test.sh because the CLI harness — the
# node/log/gh-backing scaffolding — already lives in this file for the switch
# and the limit flag, and a third flag reusing the identical mechanism does
# not earn a second copy of it. lib/merge-autonomy.sh's own config-resolution
# and kill-switch unit coverage is test/merge-autonomy.test.sh's job.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/toggle.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# lib/toggle.sh declares `local state_dir="$1"` in each of its functions, and
# this file happens to call them with a global of the same name. Reading them
# together, shellcheck takes the locals for writes to our global and warns that
# the writes are lost in the command substitutions they happen in — but there
# is no write: every one is a `local`, and this file only ever reads its own.

#   - an unreachable state repo must fall back to the cached copy, and to
#     enabled with none — never crash a cycle;
#   - a 404 is "clear", definitively, and must also clear the cache;
#   - a garbage flag reads as disabled, like a garbage local record;
#   - the limit flag only ever extends, whatever order writes land in;
#   - "cleared" must never be reported for a flag that is still set.
