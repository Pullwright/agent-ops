# test/dashboard-render.test.sh — the first test of the ~1,265 lines of inline
# JavaScript in dashboard/index.html: what it *renders*, not just whether it
# throws (TD-PPagop-26072606).
#
# `docs/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md`'s verification list already asked for a headless
# render with no thrown errors, which catches a page that breaks and nothing
# about a page that lies — and the Outcome column's "Ended" on a running cycle
# (#94) is exactly that: it shipped, and stayed shipped, because reading the
# log-derived event ladder in isolation looks correct, and no test named the
# gap between a rule written for finished cycles and a column that renders
# unfinished ones.
#
# So this feeds checked-in JSON DASHBOARD_DATA fixtures through the page's own
# script — unmodified, via test/dashboard-render-harness.js — under a DOM stub
# that only builds trees (createElement/createTextNode/appendChild, plus a
# serialiser), and greps the rendered output for the cells under test. That
# stub is a maintenance liability if it grows to chase page features, so it
# stays to the tree-building subset: pointer/focus-driven behaviour (the
# pull-request hover card, #96) is out of scope, same as the record notes.
#
# Fixture timestamps are relative-time tokens ("@now", "@ago:5m") resolved by
# the harness at run time, not baked in — otherwise every "3m ago" assertion
# would rot the day it was written.
#
# No network. The rendered assertions need node, which the image carries for
# the Claude CLI; absent, they skip with a note rather than failing, as the
# record asks for and as test/render-crontab.test.sh does for supercronic —
# but the plain-grep check of the header's static documentation links runs
# either way, since it needs nothing but the file itself.
#
# Run directly: ./test/dashboard-render.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
