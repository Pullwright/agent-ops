# test/chain.test.sh — regression test for lib/chain.sh (finish-then-continue,
# requirement 39).
#
# The two ways this can go wrong are opposite failures, and both are silent
# in production: chaining when it should not (a fleet that never yields the
# lock, or a lineage that outruns max_chained_cycles) or not chaining when it
# should (right back to the one-item-per-cron-firing pickup latency #248
# exists to fix). So the assertions below check the boundary in both
# directions on both inputs — chain_count against max_chained_cycles, and an
# empty `.sources` against a non-empty one — rather than one happy-path case.
#
# Also covers `chain_image_behind` and `chain_write_roll_pending`
# (agent-ops#1096): the cycle-end check that yields a chain a healthy node
# would otherwise take when the running image has fallen behind, and the
# marker it writes so deploy/docker/watchtower-pre-update.sh's own test can
# pick up where this one leaves off. And `chain_clear_landed_roll_pending`
# (agent-ops#1102): the other half, called back at the top of the next cycle
# to shed that marker once it has either done its job or was never earned by
# this node's own current image.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/chain.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
