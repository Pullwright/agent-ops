# test/preview-deploy.test.sh — the preview-deployment check (scripts/preview-deploy.sh),
# against a stubbed `gh` and `curl` on PATH: no GitHub and no Vercel exist where
# this suite runs, and the script's job is verdicts, not either API.
#
# The property the whole script exists for is the third one below. A protected
# preview answers 302 → vercel.com/login, and a check that follows redirects and
# reads the status code sees 200: a login page certified as a healthy
# deployment. It must read as "could not check", and it must say which secret is
# missing — a preview nobody can reach is a fact about the node, not the branch.
#
# The rest:
#   - a built deployment whose page answers is a pass, and the bypass secret
#     travels in the x-vercel-protection-bypass header (the stub answers the
#     wall to anyone who does not send the right one);
#   - a bypass secret that is set and rejected is a different message from one
#     that was never set — the two have different fixes;
#   - a failed build is exit 1 and names the inspector; with VERCEL_TOKEN it
#     also carries the tail of the build log;
#   - a deployment that built and then serves an error is exit 1, distinct from
#     a build failure;
#   - an ordinary application redirect is followed rather than mistaken for the
#     wall;
#   - no Preview deployment, and a deployment still building, are both "could
#     not check" (exit 2) — never a pass;
#   - --wait polls until the deployment reaches a terminal state.
#
# Run directly: ./test/preview-deploy.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
