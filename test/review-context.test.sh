# test/review-context.test.sh — regression test for lib/review-context.sh
# (issue #589, D7 in docs/ROADMAP.md: per-repository instructions and
# context for the Reviewer-Agent).
#
# What matters here is the trust boundary the whole facility exists to
# enforce: a configured (installation-held) source is exactly as trustworthy
# as `prompt_overrides`, but — unlike a `prompt_overrides` path — a missing
# one is a loud failure rather than a silent skip (review_context_missing_configured,
# shared by review-cycle.sh's own fail-fast sweep and scripts/doctor.sh's
# `fail`); a repository-held source (`repo_context_file`) is the opposite —
# admissible as context only, and simply absent when the file is not there,
# never a fault. So the assertions below are, in order: path resolution,
# the missing-configured-path detector, config_repository_review_repos'
# resolution precedence (requirement 342) as read by this facility, building
# the runtime-input JSON (instructions/context, in order, each attributed),
# the absent-repo-file case, the size cap and its truncation flag, and that
# the digest reduction never carries the text itself.
#
# The structural shape of the new config.schema.json keys — array-only,
# never a bare string — is that schema's concern, not this file's;
# test/config-schema.test.sh covers it.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/review-context.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# shellcheck disable=SC2317  # assertions run indirectly, inside command substitutions.
