# test/landing.test.sh — regression test for lib/landing.sh (D18 WI-7,
# docs/reviews/2026-08-14-autonomy-investigation.md §5.1, §6, §7;
# agent-ops#410): the deterministic eligibility classifier and the arming
# primitives.
#
# Covers, against a stubbed `gh`:
#   - landing_protected_paths_hit: a protected path is reported and exits 0,
#     all nine prefixes are recognised (the three the first draft deferred
#     to human review — `config.json`, `agent-cycle.sh`, `review-cycle.sh` —
#     each pinned singly as well), a nested or suffixed near-miss is not
#     protected, an all-clear set exits 1 with nothing printed, an unreadable
#     or truncated changed-file listing exits 2 (never a pass), a
#     protected-paths list holding a non-string entry instead exits 3 —
#     distinct from 2 rather than reading as "no match" (TD-PPagop-26082320)
#     or being conflated with the changed-file-list cause
#     (TD-PPagop-26082325) — bad arguments are rejected before any gh call,
#     and the read reaches GitHub as an explicit GET (agent-ops#718 — the
#     stubbed `gh` models `gh api`'s own method selection, so a
#     field-carrying request that forgets `--method GET` 404s here exactly
#     as it did in production).
#   - landing_eligible: LEVEL below agent-merges-routine, a COMPLEXITY outside
#     the routine-complexity list (default `low`/`medium`), and a SOURCE
#     outside the routine list are each `ineligible` with no gh call at all;
#     a repo-level merge_autonomy_routine_sources override widens what that
#     one repository accepts; a repo-level merge_autonomy_routine_complexity
#     override likewise widens the complexity ceiling, admitting `high`
#     (D18 Stage 3, agent-ops#725); a protected path is `ineligible`; an
#     unreadable changed-file list is `unknown`, blaming the changed-file
#     list by name, and a protected-paths list that cannot be evaluated at
#     all (TD-PPagop-26082320) is also `unknown` but names
#     `merge_autonomy_protected_paths` instead (TD-PPagop-26082325) — never a
#     pass either way, and neither is an exit code outside
#     `landing_protected_paths_hit`'s own documented 0/1/2/3 contract
#     (agent-ops#1232), pinned against a temporarily substituted helper since
#     the real one never produces one; the
#     plain-string SOURCE comparison this file's own header documents is
#     pinned directly — a plain `issues` entry in the routine list matches
#     the word a real issues work order always carries, and an `issues:low`
#     entry (a schema error since agent-ops#558) still does not, because the
#     comparison folds no bands.
#   - landing_arm: a base branch with an active merge queue enqueues via
#     the enqueuePullRequest mutation; one without falls back to
#     `gh pr merge --auto --squash`; both write under GH_TOKEN for that one
#     invocation only; an unreadable pull request, an unreadable queue
#     probe, a refused mutation or a refused merge each return non-zero
#     printing nothing, each with its own distinguishable exit status
#     (agent-ops#532); bad arguments are rejected before any gh call.
#     `_landing_arm_failure_reason` is pinned directly for every code it maps.
#   - landing_retry_source (TD-PPagop-26081701): the most recent matching
#     `selection` event's source wins when a branch was claimed more than
#     once, a malformed log line is skipped rather than aborting the read,
#     an unmatched repo/branch or an unreadable log both print nothing, and
#     stdin works the same as a named LOG_FILE.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/landing.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
