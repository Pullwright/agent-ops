# test/memory.test.sh — regression test for lib/memory.sh: the pure
# free-memory arithmetic doctor.sh's advisory warning and agent-cycle.sh's
# pre-cycle stand-down gate (requirement 2.0f) share, so the two cannot
# silently disagree about what "low" means, plus the read-only cgroup

# test/memory-wiring.test.sh covers whether the cycle actually acts on these

# host's real memory or on being run inside a container at all.

#   ./test/memory.test.sh

# own (say 3072 MiB against 1536 MiB) still livelocks when the parent's
# memory.high sits more than 25% below this container's own memory.max — the
# kernel's reclaim under memory.high throttles too severely across that wide a
# band for the workload to ever reach either kill point. The discriminator is
# the band's width, so a narrow band must keep reading `parented`: the interim
# ockham remedy (parent memory.high 1400 MiB, parent memory.max 2048 MiB, this
# container's own memory.max 1536 MiB — an ~8.9% gap) is exactly this shape,
# and a naive "any parent high below the child's own max is livelocked" rule
# would wrongly condemn it. The narrow-band case itself is already covered
# above (the "ceiling on the parent... is parented" case uses this exact
# shape); what's new here is the boundary either side of the 25% threshold.
