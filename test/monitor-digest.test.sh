# test/monitor-digest.test.sh — lib/monitor-digest.sh, the deterministic
# digest the Pipeline Monitor reads instead of the fleet's own records
# (agent-ops#1284, docs/MONITOR-PIPELINE-SPEC.md M6/M6a/M6b/M7).
#
# Every function under test is a pure reader, which is what makes this file
# possible at all: fixture logs and a fixture state tree on disk, no network,
# no `gh`, no config.json. What it guards:
#
#   the window        an event outside the 24 h window contributes to nothing
#                     — not the counts, not the samples, not the folds. A
#                     digest that quietly widened its window would read as a
#                     spike on the day it did.
#   the samples       newest first, capped, and the cap is what the caller
#                     asked for. The count is the reading and the sample is
#                     its evidence, so a class whose count says 9 and whose
#                     samples say 3 is correct, and a class whose samples are
#                     the *oldest* three is describing yesterday.
#   the folds         selections per band, stand-downs per cause,
#                     `none-selected` reasons verbatim, the fit rung
#                     histogram. These are the three readings agent-ops#1126
#                     had to reconstruct by hand; if any of them silently
#                     returns `[]` the Monitor's second question has no
#                     evidence behind it and nothing says so.
#   the nodes         a peer's verdicts come from its own heartbeat, this
#                     node's from the files its heartbeat is folded from, and
#                     a node with no host-facts record reads `null` rather
#                     than being omitted.
#   the bound         M7's ladder, measured in bytes: the rendered digest is
#                     never larger than the bound at any rung, including the
#                     truncating one, and the rung climbs as the bound
#                     tightens. This is the requirement with the most ways to
#                     be quietly wrong — a character count instead of a byte
#                     count overshoots by exactly the multi-byte overhead the
#                     bound exists to keep out.
#   degradation       every reader returns its empty shape for a missing
#                     file. A monitor run over a fleet whose peers have not
#                     synced is a run with less to say, never a failed one.
#
