# --- The pick does not slice its sorted stream with a reader that quits -----
# agent-ops#806's own shape: the pick's `sort` cannot emit until it has read
# every candidate, so a reader that closes the pipe on its first line takes
# SIGPIPE, `pipefail` promotes the 141 to the whole pipeline, and the
# caller's `$(…)` under `set -e` (lib/candidate-gather.sh) aborts the gather
# and with it the cycle. It only bites once the sorted output outgrows the
# 64 KiB pipe buffer, which no live `repositories` list approaches — which is
# exactly why the shape has to be pinned rather than reasoned about. This set
# is deliberately past that buffer: with `head -n1` the caller below exits
# 141, with a reader that consumes its input (`sed -n '1p'`) it exits 0.
#
# The caller runs as its own `bash -c` rather than a subshell here, and that
# is load-bearing: a `( … ) || status=$?` would put the subshell in a context
# where bash suppresses `set -e` *inside* it too, so the failing assignment
# would be ignored and this assertion would pass against either reader. A
# separate process, with `$?` read on the next line, reproduces the real
# caller's errexit rather than a defanged copy of it.
# The set travels as a file, not as an argument: 2000 slugs is past Linux's
# own 128 KiB ceiling on a single argv string, and an `Argument list too long`
# would fail this assertion for a reason that has nothing to do with the pick.
