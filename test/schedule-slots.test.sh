# test/schedule-slots.test.sh — the overrun-slot skip (requirement 11a,
# agent-ops#1287): supercronic will not start a job while the previous run
# of that job is still running, and logs the drop only to a container log
# the fleet never reads. Two things are under test here:
#
#   lib/schedule-slots.sh's `schedule_overrun_slots` — a pure function
#     tested directly against fixture `schedule` blocks: given a cycle's own
#     [start, end] span, does it name exactly the slots that fell strictly
#     inside it, honouring `cycle_interval_minutes`, `excluded_minutes` and
#     `cycle_hours` (including an hour-boundary crossing, and an hour
#     `cycle_hours` excludes entirely)?
#
#   agent-cycle.sh's own cleanup-time call site — the "Overrun-slot skips"
#     block, lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh the same way
#     test/finish-then-continue.test.sh lifts its own block, rather than
#     restated, so this cannot pass against a copy the script has since
#     moved on from: does it log one `cycle-skipped {reason: "overlap",
#     slot_ts, held_by, elapsed_s}` per slot `schedule_overrun_slots`
#     returns, only when `lock_acquired` is `1`, and nothing at all when it
#     is `0` (a stood-down or lock-contention cycle never blocked a firing)?
#     And does it log nothing for a cycle that held the lock but is not the
#     cron-fired original — a chained continuation, a `--once` run, a
#     `--dry-run` run — whose start minute is arbitrary and whose slots
#     supercronic fired for real, the contending tick recording them?
#
#   lib/manage.sh's `overlap_status_report` — the `--status` line
#     `check-nodes.sh` (external to this repository) already prints
#     `--status` per node and so inherits for free: does it count only this
#     node's own `cycle-skipped {reason: "overlap"}` events, only the last
#     24h of them, ignoring the lock-contention `cycle-skipped` shape that
#     carries no `reason` at all?
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/schedule-slots.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
