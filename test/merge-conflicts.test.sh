# test/merge-conflicts.test.sh — regression test for the candidate rule of
# scripts/gather-merge-conflicts.sh (requirement 3g) and the back-pressure
# narrowing it shares with review-feedback and abandoned-drafts (requirement 2.2a).
#
# The rule decides which of *our own* ready PRs are conflicted and safe to rebase,
# and it has two dangerous directions:
#   - too eager, and it force-pushes a rebase onto a PR that does not really
#     conflict (mergeability is computed asynchronously, so a PR whose base just
#     moved reads `UNKNOWN` for a beat), or onto a human's branch;
#   - too shy, and a genuinely conflicted PR a human is waiting to merge sits
#     forever occupying a back-pressure slot while every cycle looks healthy.
# The `CONFLICTING`-not-`UNKNOWN` gate and the non-draft/ours-by-branch filters are
# what hold the line; they are asserted here as jq over the same shapes the GitHub
# API returns. Keep this in step with the filters in the script.
#
# The `bot` half of the rule (requirement 3s, issue #250 — Dependabot's own
# conflicted PRs, `rebase_requested` and `superseded_by`) is exercised for real,
# through MERGE_CONFLICTS_GH, further down: unlike the ours-by-label filter
# above, its logic (lib/dependabot-bump.sh, comment-marker scanning) is enough
# to be worth invoking the actual script against a stub rather than
# re-replicating it in jq a second time.
#
# Further down still: agent-cycle.sh's own `gather_merge_conflicts` wrapper,
# lifted straight out of the script (as test/stage-salvage.test.sh already
# does for its own functions), pinning that its nudge-failure fallback drops a
# never-nudged bot candidate exactly as scripts/nudge-dependabot-rebase.sh
# itself would — the third leg of requirement 3s's defence in depth, alongside
# the write-side drop and prompts/coordinator.md's explicit fourth case.
#
# Run directly:
#
#   ./test/merge-conflicts.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# emit()'s per-candidate append used to deliver $cand to jq as `--argjson c`,
# an argv entry capped at 131072 bytes. Nothing bounds a PR body, so a
# CONFLICTING PR with an oversized body used to die the whole gather under
# `set -e` at `execve`, losing this repo's entire merge_conflicts band. The
# fix moves the append to stdin, which has no such cap: this PR proves a
# 150000-byte body candidate still comes out the other end.

# --- Neither converted site drops a candidate silently --------------------------
# Both sites fail open per candidate, which is right: this gather losing one
# conflicted pull request beats it losing every other one alongside. Failing
# open *silently* is not — this is the band whose whole job is visibility, and
# a candidate that leaves it with no stderr, no event and nothing in the output
# cannot be told from a candidate that was never there. The reference
# conversion named in TD-PPagop-26081401's own record,
# scripts/gather-tech-debt.sh's `|| degrade "array assembly failed at …"`,
# keeps its converted append loud for exactly that reason.
#
# A source-level pin because emit()'s two jq calls have no reachable failure
# left to provoke from outside: what they read is jq's own output either way,
# so the argv cap this item removed was how they failed. Read the function
# rather than the behaviour — a reintroduced `2>/dev/null` fails here.
