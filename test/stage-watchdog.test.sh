# test/stage-watchdog.test.sh — the liveness watchdog of requirement 4e: a
# stage that stops producing is stopped, one that keeps producing is not, and
# the two kinds of kill are told apart afterwards.
#
# The second of those is the assertion that matters most, and it is easy to
# lose sight of. The failure this whole mechanism replaces was not "hung
# stages went unnoticed" — in 456 recorded stage runs there was never one
# genuinely hung actor. It was the opposite: a wall-clock cap killing stages
# that were working, at a tempo indistinguishable from the runs beside them
# that finished. A watchdog that kills a busy stage would be that same failure
# arriving from the other side, so "a stage emitting steadily survives a span
# several times its threshold" is tested first-class here, not as an
# afterthought to the kill.
#
# What the other cases pin down:
#
#   backstop vs inactivity   both kills exit 124, and only `kill_reason`
#                            separates them. They are opposite findings — one
#                            says the cap is too tight for work that was
#                            progressing, the other says the stage stopped —
#                            so a reader that cannot tell them apart draws the
#                            wrong correction from either.
#   0 disables               the documented escape hatch. If a node's runtime
#                            ever buffers stdout, every healthy stage would
#                            otherwise be killed at its threshold, and this is
#                            what an operator reaches for.
#   the stream survives      a killed stage's forensics are the only record of
#                            what it had done, since its envelope is never
#                            written. A kill that took the stream with it
#                            would leave the same nothing the non-streaming
#                            format left.
#   no orphaned model        the kill goes to the process group, as the
#                            backstop's always has.
#
# Timings are deliberately short (seconds, not minutes) and the assertions
# one-sided wherever a clock is involved. The poll loop wakes every two
# seconds, so every threshold here is a comfortable multiple of that.
#
# `claude` is a stub on PATH — no network, no model, no cost.
#
# Run directly: ./test/stage-watchdog.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
