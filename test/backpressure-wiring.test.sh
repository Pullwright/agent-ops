# test/backpressure-wiring.test.sh — regression test for requirement 2.2's
# counting block in agent-cycle.sh: not whether the parts are right (they have
# their own tests) but whether the block hands them to each other correctly.
#
# That seam is where this gate keeps going wrong, twice in a week. Issue #427
# was the dashboard's copy of the sum omitting live claims entirely; PR #434
# added them and counted every row in the registry, tombstones and
# already-raised PRs alike, so the gauge pinned red against a gate that was
# open. Both defects lived in the wiring, and both shipped past a test suite
# that covers `lib/claim.sh count` thoroughly and the block calling it not at
# all.
#
# So the assertions here are about what the block *passes*, and what it makes
# of the answers:
#
#   - **Each repo's claim count is asked for against that repo's own PRs.**
#     `claim.sh count` drops a claim that merely names a pull request already
#     inside the sum, and it can only do that if it is told which those are —
#     per repo, since PR numbers are unique only within one.
#   - **"Already inside the sum" means drafts and changes-requested PRs, and
#     nothing else.** A ready PR waiting on a human is deliberately excluded
#     from the trip (agent-ops#246), so its claim must keep counting: it is
#     then the only record that the work is in flight.
#   - **An unreadable listing names no PRs at all.** Every claim then counts,
#     which is the fail-closed reading and matches the zeroed PR counts beside
#     it: of the two ways to be wrong here, only "stood down when it could have
#     run" is recoverable next cycle.
#   - **The composition line states the split the operator reads.** It is the
#     one record of which part filled the gate, and the dashboard card is
#     written to match it word for word.
#
# The block is lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the way
# test/auth-failure-wiring.test.sh lifts its own, so the assertions are about
# the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic.
#
# No network: `gh` and `lib/claim.sh` are both stubs, the first replaying a
# per-repo listing and the second recording the argv it was handed.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
# ./test/backpressure-wiring.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.

# --- Issue #946 review follow-up (PR #1048): AC2 as literally written asks
#     for a scenario at agent-merges-all, and no test anywhere in this file
#     runs the block above agent-merges-routine — so a regression that
#     re-introduced a level-specific gate above that rank (rather than "or
#     above", as amended requirement 2.2 and lib/landing.sh's own
#     landing_routine_eligible state) would pass every existing assertion.
#     Same shape as the mixed-listing scenario above, one level higher: an
#     otherwise-eligible PR (#990, complexity:low) still counts toward the
#     cap, and a landing-ineligible one (#991, complexity:high) is still
#     narrowed into the human queue, at agent-merges-all. ---

# --- Issue #502 (PR #499 review follow-up): fleet_flag_fetch_status
#     memoises a live/clear answer per (flag, state_dir) for the life of this

#     once per repository, all inside this one run_block invocation — must
#     hit the network for it at most once regardless of repository count. And
#     the reordered merge_autonomy_effective_level (same PR) must never even
#     ask for a repo's freeze flag when its configured level already ranks at
#     or below agent-approves, where the freeze's own answer would go
#     unread. GH_API_CALLS records every `gh api repos/*/contents/*` call the
#     stub above serves — one line per call — so both are countable. ---

#
# The pre-existing SC2154 #499's PR body flagged: `--arg d "…could not settle
# $u…"` interpolated a bash variable `u` that is never assigned in this
# file — `$u` is jq's own `--arg u`, not a shell variable — so under `set -u`
# (which agent-cycle.sh runs under) the expansion aborted that command
# substitution and `log_event "warning" ""` logged an event with no fields at
# all: no detail, and — on the one line where a human most needs it — no
# pr_url either. Lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the same way the
# counting block above is, so this is testing the shipped function, not a
# copy of it.

# The same scan #499 added, adjusted for #771 rather than dropped. What it is

# argument and not a shell variable at all, which under `set -u` aborts the
# command substitution and logs an event with no fields.
#
# What changed is that agent-cycle.sh is now the cycle's spine and reads
# globals the lib/*.sh modules assign, and shellcheck without `-x` sees none
# of them — while `-x` here would parse the whole 26,000-line union and need
# more than 4.5 GiB, which is the very thing #770/#771 are about. So each
# SC2154 is resolved against the modules by hand: a name some module assigns
# *as a global* is an artefact of the unfollowed sources, and a name nothing
# assigns is the bug this scan exists to catch. "As a global" means assigned
# in a module that never declares it `local` — without which a jq `--arg u`
# would be excused by any `local u` in any module, which is exactly the
# finding #499 was about.
