# test/enabler-eligibility.test.sh — regression test for the Enabler's
# eligibility rule (`enabler_eligible_items` in lib/cycle-state.sh,
# requirement 35a).
#
# This rule decides when the pipeline spends an Opus pass, and it is wrong in
# two directions with very different costs. Too permissive and a
# permanently-stuck item is re-examined every cycle, or a duplicate issue is
# filed at the human; too strict and the escalation path never fires at all,
# which looks exactly like a pipeline with nothing to escalate. Both failures
# are silent, so every boundary below is asserted on both sides of itself.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo); this is a
# plain bash script with hand-rolled assertions. Run it directly:
#
#   ./test/enabler-eligibility.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
