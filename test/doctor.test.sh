# test/doctor.test.sh — the four network- and render-facing checks
# scripts/doctor.sh added on top of test/config-schema.test.sh's coverage of
# its configuration half (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC.md component 14):
# write access to every target repository, Claude credentials, the rendered
# crontab, and the `nice` reordering report.
#
# scripts/doctor.sh has no override variable for `gh` or `claude` (unlike
# lib/labels.sh's LABELS_GH) — it calls both by their bare name — so both are
# stubbed by prepending a directory to PATH. These assertions therefore run
# *without* --offline: --offline is what test/config-schema.test.sh already
# covers, and skipping every network-gated check here would leave the checks
# themselves untested. No real network call is possible through `gh` or
# `claude`, because neither ever resolves to anything but the stubs below.
#
# lib/approver-token.sh's live installation-permissions read (D18 Stage 3,
# agent-ops#575) is the one exception: it calls `curl` directly, stubbed the
# same way test/approver-token.test.sh stubs it, through APPROVER_TOKEN_CURL
# — never left to resolve to a real `curl`. Every invocation below also
# explicitly clears PULLWRIGHT_APPROVER_APP_ID/_INSTALLATION_ID/
# _PRIVATE_KEY_PATH and, since D25/agent-ops#607 added a second identity,
# PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_APP_ID/_INSTALLATION_ID/_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH too (`env -u`)
# before setting any of its own: a node this suite runs on may carry the
# fleet's own real Approver or forge authoring App credentials in its
# environment, and without the clear this check would sign a real JWT and
# call the real GitHub API using them.
#
# The renderer-failure and missing-template cases use the real
# deploy/docker/render-crontab.sh rather than a stub: a config whose
# schedule.excluded_minutes rules out every minute is a genuine failure the
# real renderer already produces, and a missing template is reproduced by
# running a trimmed copy of the repository that omits it — so what is under
# test is doctor.sh's own reaction, not a fabricated substitute for the
# renderer's behaviour.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo); this is a
# plain bash script with hand-rolled assertions. Run it directly:
#
#   ./test/doctor.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# --- A single-target-repo fixture, so the stub above only ever has to
#     answer one `repos/<slug>` call per run. Review repos, state_repo and the
#     Enabler are all switched off for the same reason — none of them is
#     what this suite tests, and every one left on is another call the stub
#     would need to arbitrate.
#
#     The D18 autonomy keys are deleted for a different reason: the merge
#     autonomy assertions below are *cross-key* rules, and each one wants a
#     specific combination of set and unset. They were written when the
#     shipped config carried none of these keys, so "unset" came for free and
#     each test only ever set what it needed. Stage 1 entry then set
#     merge_autonomy, approver_app_id and the model tiers for real, and six
#     assertions inverted — every one that depended on a key being absent
#     (#546). Deleting them here restores the known-empty baseline those
#     assertions are written against, so each test states its own combination
#     explicitly and none of them depends on what the fleet's current stage
#     happens to be.
#
#     `schedule` is pinned for a third reason, and the plainest one: the
#     crontab report below asserts the exact minutes it renders, and every one
#     of those minutes came from whatever the shipped `schedule` happened to
#     say. Changing a cadence in config.json is a configuration change, and it
#     must not oblige anyone to re-derive an assertion here — so the block
#     states its own, deliberately unlike the shipped values, and the
#     assertions read from it. ---

# phrases alone ("memory.high set to", "memory.max cannot be read") anchored
# straight after "container memory: " matches neither — which is how a node
# genuinely in the `unconfirmed` band (a real parent memory.high with no
# memory.max window mounted, i.e. one not yet re-run through
# cgroup-parent-setup.sh) failed this assertion while doctor.sh was emitting
