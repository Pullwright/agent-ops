# test/author-token.test.sh — regression test for lib/author-token.sh (D18
# decision 1, agent-ops#607 Phase 2).
#
# lib/author-token.sh is a thin wrapper over the same lib/github-app-token.sh
# mechanics test/approver-token.test.sh already exercises in full — the JWT
# signing, the mint, the cache's expiry/ownership/tmpfs-only guarantees — so
# this file does not re-prove all of that. It proves instead that the forge
# authoring App's own three environment variables, cache-file prefix and
# override variables are wired correctly and stay isolated from the
# Approver's: what must hold, always, is that a caller never mistakes "no
# credential" for "a token", never sees a GH_TOKEN fallback anywhere in this
# file, and never has this identity's cache collide with the Approver's.
#
# Since the per-owner installation map (`PULLWRIGHT_AUTHOR_INSTALLATION_IDS`,
# the shape agent-ops#913 gave the Approver) it also proves the resolution
# rules themselves — `author_token_installation_for_owner`,
# `author_token_any_installation_id`, and which installation
# `author_token_get`/`author_token_identity_login` actually mint against for
# a given owner. What must hold there is that an owner nothing configures
# resolves to *nothing* rather than to another owner's installation (which
# would 404 at write time instead of failing as a readable gate), and that
# two owners' tokens never share a cache file.
#
# `curl` is stubbed through AUTHOR_TOKEN_CURL; real `openssl` signs a
# throwaway RSA key generated for this run, so the JWT-building path is
# exercised for real rather than faked.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run it
# directly:
#
#   ./test/author-token.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
