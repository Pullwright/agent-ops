# test/enabler-notify-wiring.test.sh — regression test for requirement 2m's
# `escalation` class as wired into `lib/enabler.sh` (issue #1279).
#
# test/notify.test.sh covers `notify_post` itself — the classes, the alias,
# the per-(event, key) rate limit, the failure paths. This file covers the
# other half: that `create_escalation_issue` actually calls it, on the right
# paths, with the right event, and — the part that matters most — that adding
# a notification to a function every escalation route files through changed
# nothing about what that function returns to its callers.
#
# It is the successor to test/escalation-webhook.test.sh (TD-PPagop-26082304),
# which covered the same wiring back when the webhook was a filing-failure
# fallback and nothing else. The contract it guarded still holds and is
# re-asserted here against the new event names: a failed filing still returns
# 1 and still prints nothing, a successful one still prints `<number>\t<url>`,
# and the duplicate-guard path still short-circuits before either.
#
# Three routes reach GitHub through `create_escalation_issue` with the same
# `GH_TOKEN` an escalation's own trigger may have just shown GitHub rejects —
# requirement 2.0b's auth-failure check, 1c's usage-limit freeze, requirement
# 2.7's crash loop — which is why the notification lives inside the shared
# function rather than at each call site.
#
# `create_escalation_issue` and `escalation_webhook_notify` are lifted
# verbatim out of lib/enabler.sh, the way test/escalation-webhook.test.sh did
# before it and test/cycle-state.test.sh still does, so these assertions are
# about the shipped code rather than a reimplementation that could drift from
# it. lib/notify.sh is sourced whole: it is standalone by design.
#
# No network: `gh` and `curl` are both stubs recording the argv (and, for
# `curl`, the POSTed body) they were handed.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly: ./test/enabler-notify-wiring.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
