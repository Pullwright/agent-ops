# test/review-context-wiring.test.sh — R1c is wired into `review-cycle.sh`
# itself, not merely available to it.
#
# test/review-context.test.sh proves `review_context_missing_configured`
# reports a broken `review_instructions`/`review_context` path, and
# test/config-schema.test.sh proves `scripts/doctor.sh` turns that report
# into a `fail`. Neither proves the thing R1c actually promises: that the
# *cycle* refuses to start. A sweep that is written but never called, or
# called after the lock is taken, or called with the un-resolved config
# instead of the requirement-342 output, passes both of those files and
# still reviews every configured repository against less than the operator
# asked for — silently, which is the exact failure the fail-fast exists to
# prevent.
#
# Four behaviours:
#
#   broken path   a configured `review_instructions` entry that does not
#                 resolve exits the cycle non-zero, before any repository is
#                 touched, naming the repository, the field and the path so
#                 an operator can fix it without reading the source
#   per-repo      the same for a `review_context` override on one
#                 repository's own `repos[]` entry — the sweep reads
#                 requirement 342's resolved view, not `defaults` alone
#   resolvable    a path that does resolve is silently fine: no refusal, and
#                 the tick ends 0
#   unconfigured  and neither key configured at all is vacuously fine, which
#                 is every installation that does not use the facility
#
# The shim-node harness is test/review-not-before.test.sh's, for the same
# reason it gives: the real `review-cycle.sh` runs against a directory of
# symlinks back into this tree with a `config.json` of its own, so what is
# under test is the shipped script rather than a re-statement of it.
#
# No network — the refusal happens before the lock and before any `gh` call,
# and `repository_review.repos` is otherwise emptied. Run directly:
# ./test/review-context-wiring.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
