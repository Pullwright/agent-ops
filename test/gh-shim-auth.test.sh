# test/gh-shim-auth.test.sh — regression test for lib/gh-shim.sh's
# `gh_shim_resolve_token`: the forge authoring App's on-demand credential
# seam (D18 decision 1 as amended, agent-ops#1021, TD-PPagop-26082833).
#
# What must hold, always: a cycle that outlives a minted installation
# token's ~1 h lifetime must present a *fresh* one to its next `git`/`gh`
# authoring call, never the stale one that was valid when the cycle started.
# `test/gh-shim.test.sh` already covers this file's transport mechanics
# (classification, caching, last-known-good) in full; this file covers only
# `gh_shim_resolve_token` and the "explicit wins; empty resolves" contract it
# implements, end to end against a stub "real gh" binary — never a live App
# or network call.
#
# Since the per-owner installation map it also covers `gh_shim_target_owner`,
# which decides *which* installation a given call mints against. Two things
# must hold there and are asserted separately: every invocation shape this
# fleet issues names its owner (an explicit `-R`, a positional slug or URL, a
# `gh api` path, a graphql `owner` field or `repository(owner:)` literal, a
# buffered `gh auth git-credential` request's `path=`, and finally the
# `origin` remote of the work tree the call was made from), and an invocation
# that names *no* owner prints nothing — because a wrong guess resolves to
# some other account's installation, where a token 404s at write time,
# whereas no guess resolves to the operator's own scalar default.
#
# The stub "real gh" answers two shapes, both logging the `GH_TOKEN` it saw:
#
#   - `auth git-credential` — stands in for the credential helper `git push`
#     invokes (`!gh auth git-credential`, deploy/docker/entrypoint.sh),
#     answering the git-credential protocol with whatever token it was
#     given, so this file can assert on the very credential a `git push`
#     would receive.
#   - any other argv (`pr view 5`) — stands in for an ordinary `gh` call.
#
# `curl` is stubbed (AUTHOR_TOKEN_CURL, the same shape
# test/author-token.test.sh uses); real `openssl` signs a throwaway RSA key,
# so the JWT-building path is exercised for real. Stub ordering matters here
# (lib/gh-shim.sh's own header): the stub is never placed ahead of the shim
# on `PATH` — it is reached through AUTHOR_TOKEN_CURL, one layer below the
# shim's own dispatch, so the shim's real code path runs unmodified.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run it
# directly:
#
#   ./test/gh-shim-auth.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
