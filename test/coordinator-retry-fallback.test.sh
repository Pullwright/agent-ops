# test/coordinator-retry-fallback.test.sh — regression test for requirement
# 3v (issue #321): a corroboration-rejected `none-selected` verdict gets one
# retry, quoting the Script's own contradiction, and — only if the retry is
# rejected too — a mechanical fallback selection, so a rejected verdict costs
# at most one extra Co-Ordinator engagement, never the cycle.
#
# `run_coordinator_stage_attempt`, `fallback_select_candidate` and
# `coordinator_corroborate_retry_or_fallback` are lifted verbatim out of
# agent-cycle.sh with awk, the same technique test/enabler-verdicts.test.sh
# uses for `maybe_run_enabler` — this cannot pass against a copy the script
# has since moved on from. `unaccounted_items`,
# `log_needs_refinement_items`, `log_voided_items`, `log_unblocked_items` and
# `log_recheck_clean_items` are lifted the same way, real, so the
# corroboration math under test is the genuine accounting rather than a
# paraphrase of it (test/verdict-corroboration.test.sh already covers those
# five in isolation; this file's job is the retry/fallback orchestration
# built on top of them). `run_claude_stage` is stubbed to answer a queued
# sequence of canned verdicts — one per call — so a scenario's first and
# second Co-Ordinator engagement can answer differently, the way a genuine
# retry does.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run it
# directly:
#
#   ./test/coordinator-retry-fallback.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
