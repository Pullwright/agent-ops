# test/publish-dashboard.test.sh — regression tests for

#
# Four behaviours here have already failed in production, one is a scaling
# property, and one is an invariant the detail window's jq port could silently
# break, so they get tests rather than a careful reading:
#
#   the launcher's exit   a healthy window must end 0 — its status once came
#                         from the final tick's lock bookkeeping, so
#                         supercronic reported every successful window as a
#                         failure, every five minutes
#   the GitHub cadence    exactly one tick per window may spend API calls, and
#                         one must — the gate was once a wall-clock modulo that
#                         a cron-fired window could never satisfy, so the PR
#                         panels aged for half an hour at a time while the page
#                         around them said "data 3s ago"
#   the holed log         a container killed mid-append leaves NULs, and one NUL
#                         makes grep go quiet over the whole file — the damage
#                         is to every later read, not to the lines that were
#                         lost, so the launcher strips them and says so
#   the cost scan         batching must preserve the per-file semantics: the
#                         day cut-off, the model roll-up, tolerance of a torn
#                         envelope mid-write, and unconditional redaction
#   the process budget    a long history must not translate into thousands of
#                         jq forks per publish (tens of seconds under WSL2)
#   the transcript cap    TRANSCRIPT_CAP is a byte budget; jq's own string
#                         slicing counts codepoints, so a multi-byte-heavy
#                         transcript could blow well past the cap and grow
#                         data.js — exactly the size concern this budget exists
#                         for
#   the argv cap          the void extract grows with the log and once rode
#                         into the assemble as an --argjson, so at 132539 bytes
#                         `execve` refused it and every dashboard on the fleet
#                         froze at once (requirement 4g)
#   the failed assemble   whatever kills that jq, an empty payload must not be
#                         written over a good data.js and reported as a write
#   the cycle-less event  the union carries records no cycle produced, and
#                         grouping them by .cycle is a fatal jq error rather
#                         than a null row — one such record blanked Recent
#                         cycles fleet-wide for ten days, and the page read the
#                         empty list as an idle fleet and said so
#   the failed render     that same window is one jq program, so a fault in it
#                         empties every row at once; the publish must still
#                         complete, but must say what happened rather than
#                         serving the wreckage as a fleet that ran nothing
#
# No network and no GitHub: every publish runs --no-github against a
# synthesised state dir (a throwaway HOME, since config.json's state_dir is
# ~-relative). No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this
# repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/publish-dashboard.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# As in test/model-id.test.sh: version 0.10 of the linter reads two helpers here
# as unreachable, because the only calls to them are inside command

# one so its join into landings.armed can be checked directly; a stale
# earlier landing-audit for the clean pull request, superseded by a newer
# one, to pin the "newest event per pr_url wins" rule the join relies on;
# and a landing-audit-skip event for a fourth pull request merged by someone
# other than the Approver identity — not an audit finding, so it must never

# still completes (a broken panel must not cost the other twenty), but it says
# why on stderr and carries the verdict in the payload, which is the only thing
# that lets the page tell "rendered nothing" from "ran nothing".
# The render fails on this node's *first* publish, which is the production
# shape: nothing is cached, so every cycle in the window is one this tick had
# to render, and a failure leaves `cycles[]` genuinely empty rather than
# holding yesterday's rows. (A later failure is the milder case — the cache
# still answers for whatever it already held — and both carry the same

# --- Actor and model scorecards: the Co-Ordinator's own measure (issue #610,
# D22; supersedes issue #319's verdict-quality aggregate) --------------------
# The rate the Script rejects a Co-Ordinator verdict at (implementation spec
# 3t/3v), by the model that produced it, now folded into the Co-Ordinator
# card's own `measure` rather than a panel of its own. Both terms are counted,
# not just the rejections: the incident this came from (#310) was one node
# standing the whole fleet down for a day, and the operator question it left
# behind — is `coordinator_model` the wrong model — is a ratio, so a numerator
# with no denominator answers nothing.
#
# The unit is the verdict, not the cycle, because requirement 3v made a cycle
# able to produce two. The fixture holds one of each shape the aggregate must
# tell apart:
#
#   V1  rejected, then a retry that selected — and that pick later lands
#   V2  accepted over a non-empty eligible set    denominator only — and its
#                                                 `none-selected` must not be
#                                                 counted as a second verdict
#   V3  a `none-selected` from before 3v          1 rejected, attributed by
#                                                 its cycle's own stage-end

# Nothing measured a tick, so nothing noticed when that stopped being true: a
# publish reached 20-22s on every node and the window ran rebuilds back to back,
# ~11 per window and roughly 78% of a core, with the page byte-identical each
# time on an idle node. The three assertions below are the three halves of the
# fix that can each break on their own — the backoff exists, it does *not* cost
# an idle node its cadence, and the window stops rather than starting a tick it
# cannot fit.
#
# A stub Publisher of known cost (LAUNCHER_PUBLISH_CMD) drives all three, and
# each asserts on the *gaps between ticks* rather than on a tick count, so a

# 40 seconds, not 30, because a 30-second window cannot always fit the second
# tick this asserts on — it raced, and lost on CI's arm64 leg during the review
# of agent-ops#1383. The arithmetic: the loop admits a tick only while
# `EPOCHSECONDS < endat - tick_margin` and re-checks `endat - reserve_s` (both
# `startat + 20` at this window size, `tick_margin` and the unmeasured
# `local_cost_s` floor being 10 apiece). Tick one starts on the first 5-second
# boundary, so anywhere in `startat + 1..5`; it costs ~1.05s and earns
# ~9.45s of backoff; and the boundary alignment at the top of iteration two
# adds another 1..5s. That puts tick two's start anywhere in
# `startat + 12.5..20.5` — and the top of that range is past the bound, for no
# reason to do with how loaded the box is. Widening the window moves the bound
# to `startat + 30` and leaves the same range 10 seconds of headroom, without
# touching the backoff being measured: `min_gap` below still reads the ~10.5s
# gap the 1:9 duty ratio produces, because the clamp that could shorten it

# --- ...and the reserve is per tick kind, across windows (#807) ---------------
# The reserve above was taken against `last_cost_ms` — the previous tick, of
# whichever kind. That held only while every tick was expensive. #804 made the
# no-op path fire, so the previous tick became a sub-second skip, the reserve
# collapsed to the bare tick_margin, and a 45s GitHub tick starting in the last
# half-minute overran the window. supercronic runs no overlapping instance of a
# job, so it dropped the entire next window and the page went ten minutes
# without an update.
#
# The cost therefore has to be remembered per kind, and it has to survive the
# process: cron starts a fresh launcher every window, and the reserve is needed
# on a window's *first* tick. An in-process counter would be reset exactly when
# it is wanted — inert in production while passing any single-window test,
# which is how #793 shipped and stayed shipped for a day and a half. So the
# first window here measures a real GitHub tick, and the second reads what the

# cycle, that left the page two and a half minutes behind the pipeline it
# exists to show.
#
# So a tick now comes in two kinds. A *full* build is what it always was, and is
# what every GitHub tick runs. A *fast* build recomputes only what moves —
# status, the cycle window, the log tail, the fleet — and carries the history
# roll-ups forward from the last full payload. What follows checks that the
# carry-forward is real, that the volatile half is genuinely fresh, that a
# missing cache degrades to a full build rather than to a blank page, and that
# the per-cycle cache is both used and invalidated.

# tick always rebuilds. But between that drop and the next tick, an open tab
# is polling stamp.js against whatever *this* tick just published — and
# before this fix, that was still the real state hash. Unchanged state
# (the ordinary case: nothing about the fleet moved, only the render itself
# broke) means the same hash a healthy publish would have written, so a tab
# already holding that fingerprint would keep reading "unchanged" and never
# re-fetch the repaired page once the render started working again. The fix
# is a fallback to `$now_iso` — unique to the tick — whenever
# cycle_render_ok != true, mirroring the $fingerprint_file drop; distinguished
# here from a real hash by shape alone (a 64-hex digest vs. an ISO-8601
# instant), which needs no second publish and so cannot be timing-flaky.
