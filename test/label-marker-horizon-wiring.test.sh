# test/label-marker-horizon-wiring.test.sh — regression test for *where* in
# agent-cycle.sh requirement 39f's `union_log_horizon` is captured, and for the
# two read-back call sites that have to be handed it (agent-ops#670).
#
# `test/label-marker.test.sh` covers the halves either side of this wiring —
# `log_latest_ts` itself, and `own_class`'s grace test against a `NOW` the
# fixture hands it — and every one of those assertions passes with the wiring
# between them broken, because they drive
# `label_filter_own_applications`/`label_own_stale_applications` directly
# rather than through the cycle script. That is exactly the gap this file
# closes, and the spec's own gotchas row ("A 'snapshot' horizon captured too
# late is wall clock wearing a disguise") names the two ways it opens:
#
#   - **The capture moves after an append.** `$union_log` is not immutable
#     after it is snapshotted: the cycle appends its own fresh local log lines
#     into it three times before the requirement-39f read-back runs. A capture
#     that lands after any of them reads this node's own just-written events,
#     so the horizon tracks wall clock again and the fix evaporates silently —
#     with every fixture in `test/label-marker.test.sh` still green.
#   - **A call site stops passing it.** Both readers share
#     `_label_own_class_jq_def` precisely so they cannot disagree about a
#     candidate's class; one of them falling back to the `date -u` default
#     reintroduces that disagreement, and again changes nothing any unit
#     fixture can see.
#
# Both are textual facts about the shipped script, so this file asserts them by
# reading agent-cycle.sh (and, since #771 moved the gather loop that owns the
# appends and the two read-back call sites into lib/candidate-gather.sh,
# that file too) rather than by executing it: there is no way to observe the
# capture's *position* from inside a stubbed run of the block, and lifting
# the block verbatim (as the other `*-wiring` tests do) would lift the
# ordering along with it and assert nothing. The horizon-before-append
# ordering itself is no longer one line-number comparison in a single file —
# the three now live in different files — so it is checked in two steps: the
# horizon is captured in agent-cycle.sh before it hands off to
# `run_gather_phase` (lib/gather-phase.sh, issue #1958), whose own body calls
# `gather_ordered_repos` as its first statement; and the append/call sites are
# confirmed to exist in lib/candidate-gather.sh, which nothing runs before
# that hand-off.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/label-marker-horizon-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# lib/gather-phase.sh (issue #1958's continuation of #771's split) that hands
# control to the code owning the first of the appends that go on to mutate
# it, and that call itself. `run_gather_phase`'s own body calls
# `gather_ordered_repos` (lib/candidate-gather.sh, #771) as its first
# statement, unchanged from when that was the bare top-level call agent-
# cycle.sh made directly — only the hand-off's own name changed.

# while any peer copy was still damaged the capture below took that record's
# time for the newest logged event — the wall-clock tracking this file exists

# agent-cycle.sh, and no line of code between the snapshot and the capture
