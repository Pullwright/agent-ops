#
# The one property everything else rests on is atomicity: two nodes claiming
# the same item must produce exactly one winner, every time. The stub `gh`
# below is therefore not a canned-response stub — it implements real
# create-only semantics on the filesystem (noclobber for files, which the
# kernel arbitrates), so the concurrent tests race for real.
#
# Also covered: the release rules (a claim branch is deleted only when it is
# untouched AND no open PR uses it — pushed work is never deleted), the
# registry count that feeds back-pressure, the gc sweep's TTL, and `expire`
# (issue #237) — the backdate that lets a discarded engagement's tombstone
# retire on the next gc sweep without releasing it outright.
#
# No network and no GitHub. Run directly:
#
#   ./test/claim.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
