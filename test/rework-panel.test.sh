# test/rework-panel.test.sh — self-contained regression test for
# lib/rework-panel.sh (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md's rework and item-lifecycle
# records, D23 of docs/ROADMAP.md, issue #611).
#
# What matters here, one section per acceptance criterion:
#
#   the three questions   how much (tokens/elapsed share vs first-pass
#                         yield), whose (grouped by attributed_stage, an
#                         explicit not-attributed bucket) and how far (the
#                         escape ladder) are each computed correctly from a
#                         constructed event stream.
#   the signature         a fixture built on test/item-lifecycle.test.sh's
#                         own precedent — one log exercising every rung and
#                         class at once — demonstrates that a rising
#                         escape rate at the agent-review rung and a falling
#                         raw rework count are two different, independently
#                         reported figures: the panel never blends them into
#                         one score a Reviewer waving work through could hide
#                         behind.
#   dedup                 a repetition two nodes both logged counts once;
#                         post-merge-revert dedups additionally by
#                         evidence.by, since two distinct corrective pull
#                         requests can name the same original; an item-less
#                         fleet-wide class (crash-loop escalation, a
#                         Co-Ordinator/Enabler/Refiner backstop kill) needs
#                         ts and evidence in its dedup key too, since two
#                         genuinely distinct occurrences months apart would
#                         otherwise share the one {"","",class} key forever;
#                         and a scalar (non-object) evidence on
#                         post-merge-revert does not abort the fold.
#   degradation           a malformed line and a missing log both yield a
#                         conforming all-zero report rather than aborting the
#                         fold, while a fold that does abort internally yields
#                         the outage shape instead — the two mean opposite
#                         things and must never render alike.
#

# directly:

# =====================================================================
# The three questions, over one small, hand-traceable fixture
# =====================================================================
# item 1: clean (landed, no rework at all).
# item 2: one review-round-trip (agent-review rung, null attribution).
# item 3: one human-change-request, attributed to reviewer (human-gate rung).
# item 4: one post-merge-revert (post-merge rung, no cycle — mined after the
#         fact) on top of an earlier review-round-trip on the *same* item —
#         its furthest rung is post-merge, not double-counted at agent-review.
#         This is docs/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md's own reference case for why a
#         per-rung `caught` figure is a floor, not a defect tally: item 4's
#         agent-review round trip did catch something, but the item's
#         furthest rung is post-merge, so agent-review's own `caught` count
#         (below) is unaffected by that real catch (issue #1195).

# count move in *opposite* directions, and the panel never blends them

#
# "Before": agent review catches 4 of 5 defects (escape_rate 20%).
# "After":  agent review catches 1 of 5 defects, but the other 4 still
#           surface later (human-gate/post-merge) — a Reviewer waving work
#           through, not fewer defects. A reader looking only at the raw
#           rework count would see it fall and misread that as improvement.
