# test/gh-shim.test.sh — regression test for lib/gh-shim.sh and
# scripts/gh-shim.sh: the `gh` transport shim of requirement 2.0e
# (agent-ops#1084).
#
# Two layers:
#
#   - pure functions, sourced directly (classification, header/body
#     parsing, cache-key derivation, the last-known-good decision, the
#     invalidation heuristic);
#   - the shim end to end, run as a subprocess against a stub "real gh"
#     binary that answers from a small per-call JSON plan
#     (STUB_PLAN_DIR/<n>.json — {status, body, etag, ratelimit, rc}), so a
#     whole HTTP exchange (headers, body, status, ratelimit figures) is
#     under the test's control with no network involved. The stub prints
#     `-i`-shaped output (status line, headers, blank line, body) whenever
#     `-i`/`--include` is in its own argv — which the shim always adds for a
#     cacheable read, and never adds for anything else — and every call is
#     recorded to STUB_PLAN_DIR/calls.log for asserting exactly what the
#     shim sent (an `If-None-Match` header, or nothing extra at all).
#
# Run directly:
#
#   ./test/gh-shim.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
