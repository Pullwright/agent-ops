# test/egress-fence.test.sh — the D24 egress fence's static shape
# (IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC, "The node stack"), and the proxy start
# script's real merge behaviour.
#
# What this guards: the fence is spread across four files that only work
# together — the compose topology (internal-only network, proxy on both),
# the squid config (default-deny, CONNECT-443-only), the baked allowlist
# (every domain a cycle actually needs — several of which, like
# codeload.github.com, appear in no source file and fail as quiet degrades
# when missing), and the scheduler's proxy environment. Any one of them
# regressing leaves a fence that either blocks the fleet or fences nothing,
# and three of those failure shapes are silent. The *live* fence cannot be
# exercised here — the suite runs inside one container and cannot stand up
# Docker networks — which is exactly why scripts/doctor.sh's Egress section
# probes it per node; this file pins everything that is checkable statically,
# plus the one behavioural piece (allowlist merging) that runs anywhere.
#
# Run directly: ./test/egress-fence.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
