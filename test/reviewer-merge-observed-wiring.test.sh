# test/reviewer-merge-observed-wiring.test.sh — regression test for the two
# dispatch blocks agent-cycle.sh's Reviewer stage adds for agent-ops#916
# (requirements 31d/32c): a subject pull request that has already merged
# must never reach `pr-ready`, an Approver engagement or a landing attempt,
# whatever the Reviewer's own verdict says.
#
#   - **The stage-start advisory block** (just inside "--- 8. Reviewer stage
#     ---"): a merged `$impl_pr_url` skips the whole Reviewer engagement,
#     reaching `reviewer_merge_observed` at zero stage cost.
#   - **The handoff block** (right after `$rev_status` is parsed, ahead of
#     the ready/blocked branch): a merged `$impl_pr_url` reaches the same
#     completion whether the Reviewer's own verdict is "ready" (never
#     noticed) or "blocked" (noticed and said so); an unreadable merge state
#     on an otherwise-"ready" verdict refuses the handoff instead of running
#     it; anything else — the ordinary "open" case — falls through to the
#     pre-existing ready/blocked branch unchanged.
#
# Both blocks are lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the same technique
# test/human-reviewer-handoff-wiring.test.sh already uses: the assertions are
# about the shipped code, not a copy of its logic. `reviewer_merge_observed`,
# `log_reviewer_handback` and `pr_merge_state` are stubbed as recorders —
# each is unit-tested on its own terms elsewhere (test/merge-observed.test.sh,
# test/handoff.test.sh's `confirm_pr_ready` sibling in
# test/pr-merge-state.test.sh) — so this file owns only the thinner question:
# given each shape those three can return, does agent-cycle.sh's own
# dispatch do the right thing with it?
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/reviewer-merge-observed-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# reach the assembled file unexpanded; the single-quoted patterns and printf
# templates below are deliberate.
