# test/node-time-state.test.sh — self-contained regression test for
# lib/node-time-state.sh (docs/FLOW-SCHEMA.md's "Node time-state record",
# D21 of docs/ROADMAP.md, issue #597).
#
# What matters here:
#
#   the six states     every node-second in the window lands in exactly one
#   are exhaustive      of producing/overhead/externally-blocked/idle-with-
#   and mutually        demand/idle-without-demand/down, or unaccounted for
#   exclusive           an unrecognised `state` — never both, never neither.
#   the invariant       `expected_total_seconds` (node-count x window) equals
#   balances            the sum of every state plus `unaccounted`, asserted
#                        on a fixture exercising every state at once.
#   the cause           idle-with-demand seconds are split by the four D21
#   translation         causes; the four pre-existing stand-down causes this
#                        requirement does not rename (raced, pre-claimed,
#                        fabricated, untraceable) translate to peer-claimed/
#                        coordinator-declined via node_time_state_for_cause.
#   absence is down     a node with zero events in the window, and a node
#                        whose first event lands partway through it, both
#                        score `down` for the ungoverned stretch.
#   no double-counting  two overlapping event streams for one node (an
#                        agent-cycle.sh run and a review-cycle.sh run) do not
#                        inflate that node's total past one window's worth
#                        of seconds — every point lands on one merged,
#                        chronologically-ordered timeline.
#   degradations        a malformed raw line, an event naming no node, a
#                        `node-state` event whose `ts` is present but fails
#                        `fromdateiso8601`, and a `node-state` event with no
#                        `cause` (idle-with-demand with an unrecognised or
#                        absent cause counts under `unspecified` rather than
#                        being dropped) all yield a conforming report rather
#                        than aborting the fold.
#

# directly:
#
#   ./test/node-time-state.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# skipped tick would relabel the rest of a live Implementer engagement as this
# tick's idle. Asserted here rather than left to the emission sites' own
# comments, because "logs nothing" is invisible in every other test.
