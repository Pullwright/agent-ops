# test/landing-audit-record.test.sh — the D18 landing audit record
# (requirement 8x, agent-ops#578): one durable `landing-audit-record` event,
# written by `_landing_stage_attempt` (agent-cycle.sh) at the exact moment it
# arms a pull request, and the WI-8 dashboard digest's own consumption of it.
#
# test/landing-wiring.test.sh already proves the *wiring* — that a successful
# arm logs this event alongside `landing-armed`, from the same in-hand facts.
# This file is the deep half issue #578's own acceptance text asks for
# directly: "verifies the record structure and that digest consumption
# works." Two parts:
#
#   Part A  pins every field of the record itself, against `_landing_stage_
#           attempt` lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh (the same
#           extraction technique test/landing-wiring.test.sh already uses) —
#           the pull request's own number and head SHA, the autonomy level
#           and its resolution source, a protected-path hit (paths named,
#           not just a verdict word), and a non-empty adjudication history
#           across a refuse streak.
#   Part B  proves `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh` actually reads the record
#           back: run for real (as test/publish-dashboard.test.sh already
#           does, `--no-github` against a throwaway state dir) over a
#           synthetic `log.jsonl`, one pull request whose `landing-armed`
#           has a matching audit record and one whose does not — the tier
#           and verdict the digest renders come from the record, and the
#           unmatched landing is `anomaly: true`, never a silent null.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/landing-audit-record.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
