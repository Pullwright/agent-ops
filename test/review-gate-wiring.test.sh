# test/review-gate-wiring.test.sh — regression test for the block in
# agent-cycle.sh that decides what `handoff_complete_review`'s
# (lib/handoff.sh) verdict actually *does* at the Reviewer's `ready` handoff.
#
# Before agent-ops#440, this file stubbed `review_gate_verdict` directly and
# pinned the whole gate-then-flip sequence inline in agent-cycle.sh. That
# sequence now lives in `handoff_complete_review`, shared verbatim with the
# Enabler's `complete_handoff` recovery path (test/handoff.test.sh covers the
# function itself — every branch of `safe`/`gate`/`closing_keyword` it can
# return, including the exit-status-vs-word distinction TD-PPagop-26081305
# was filed over). What is left for this file is the thinner question: given
# each shape `handoff_complete_review` can return, does agent-cycle.sh's own
# Reviewer block react correctly?
#
#   - **`gate.word == "dirty"` ends the cycle**, recording the requirement 32a
#     handback whose `unblock_condition` names the pull-request-shaped fault.
#   - **`gate.checks_unreadable == true` ends it too, but says something
#     else.** A required-check list this node could not read is a fact about
#     the node; it earns its own `warning` — so a degraded `gh` is visible as
#     a pattern across items rather than as N pull requests each apparently
#     broken — and a handback whose `unblock_condition` points at retrying
#     rather than at a defect that may not exist.
#   - **`closing_keyword.word == "dirty"` (gate clean) ends it too**, naming
#     the missing keyword rather than either gate's own wording.
#   - **The flip itself failing (`safe: false`, everything else clean) ends
#     it with its own wording** — "still a draft", naming nothing to fix.
#   - **A non-blocking `unknown` (either gate) is none of the above.** `safe`
#     stays `true`; the block must fall through to the rest of the handoff,
#     leaving its own `warning` to the code past this extract.
#
# TD-PPagop-26081404's streak escalation is still exercised here —
# `handoff_complete_review` only reports whether the required-checks read
# failed, not how many times in a row this node has failed it — but as of
# TD-PPagop-26081603 the block calls the shared
# `review_gate_escalate_unreadable_streak` (also lifted verbatim, alongside
# the block itself) rather than running the streak-and-escalate sequence
# inline, so this file stubs only that helper's own two callees,
# `review_gate_unknown_streak_verdict` and `review_gate_degraded_since` (each
# covered by its own test in test/review-gate.test.sh), to pin the same
# behaviour:
#
#   - once `review_gate_unknown_streak_verdict` reports this node's run has
#     crossed the threshold, the block logs one `review-gate-checks-degraded`
#     escalation instead of piling another `warning` on top — and exactly
#     one: an already-escalated run (`review_gate_degraded_since`) logs
#     neither a repeat nor the warning — while still refusing the handoff
#     exactly as before.
#
# The block and the shared helper are lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh,
# the same way test/closing-keyword-wiring.test.sh lifts its own, so the
# assertions are about the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic. Their
# callees are stubbed: `handoff_complete_review`,
# `review_gate_unknown_streak_verdict` and `review_gate_degraded_since`,
# `log_event` and `log_reviewer_handback`.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/review-gate-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
