# test/issue-priority.test.sh — regression test for issue priority banding
# (docs/spec/implementation/requirements, requirement 15e).
#
# An open issue's rank in the Co-Ordinator's walk is its `Priority` issue field:
# `Urgent` outranks everything but security, `High` beats tech-debt, `Medium` is
# where issues have always sat, `Low` sits just above the automated findings. Two
# halves of that have to hold outside the model, and both fail silently if broken:
#
#   - **The default.** An issue with no `Priority` is `Medium`. Get this wrong in
#     the "lowest" direction and every untriaged issue in both repos is demoted
#     the moment the change lands — a fleet-wide re-prioritisation nobody asked
#     for, visible only as issues that stop being picked. Get it wrong in the
#     "highest" direction and an untriaged backlog outranks the finishing
#     sources. The band must also survive an organisation adding a fifth option
#     to the field, which is a thing an admin can do at any time without telling
#     anyone.
#   - **The fingerprint.** Re-prioritising an issue changes what the Co-Ordinator
#     would select while touching no commit, no alert and no PR. If the band is
#     not in the source-state digest, two cycles either side of a re-triage
#     fingerprint identically and the cycle skips — and goes on skipping. That is
#     this system's signature failure (see the Gotchas table): green, logged, and
#     idle.
#
# `scripts/gather-source-state.sh` is run for real here against a stubbed `gh`,
# so the assertions are about the shipped filter rather than a copy of it.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/issue-priority.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# raw, not as JSON (which is why the script pipes scalars through `@json`).
# `jq -rc` reproduces that exactly. `--paginate` (the issues and open-PR
# listings, requirement 3b's completeness rule) is accepted and answered with
# the single page the fixture is — it fits one page, so paging adds nothing
# here; test/gather-source-state.test.sh is where the page semantics
# themselves are emulated and pinned.
