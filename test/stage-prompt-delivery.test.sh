#
# test/stage-prompt-delivery.test.sh — a stage prompt reaches `claude` on stdin,
# whatever its size (requirement 4c).
#
# What this guards: Linux caps a *single* argv entry at MAX_ARG_STRLEN — 32
# pages, 131072 bytes, a compile-time constant no `ulimit` raises. `getconf
# ARG_MAX` reports the limit on the *total*, megabytes larger, and is no guide
# to it at all. So `claude -p "$prompt"` works right up until the assembled
# prompt crosses that line, and then fails at `execve` with E2BIG, before the
# model is ever reached.
#
# On 2026-08-01 it crossed. `prompts/coordinator.md` had grown from 37850 bytes
# to 62603 over a week of ordinary requirement work; the assembled Co-Ordinator
# prompt reached 131441 bytes, and every node in the fleet went quiet inside the
# hour — the stage exiting 126, the cycle logging `attempt-failed` and then
# `cycle-end exit_code 0`, and the dashboard showing four healthy idle nodes.
# The prompt ships in the image, so a single roll broke all of them together.
#
# The property under test is therefore *not* "the prompt is delivered" (which
# the argv version also satisfied, for a year) but "the prompt is delivered at a
# size the argv version could not carry". Both cycle scripts are covered by one
# check because since requirement 4d they call one `run_model_stage`, in
# `lib/stage-run.sh`; that they still do is asserted here rather than assumed,
# since the review pipeline's smaller prompt makes it the one that would sit
# broken longest unnoticed if a copy ever grew back.
#
# The function is sourced from the library rather than restated here, so this
# cannot pass against an implementation the pipelines have since moved on from;
# the source path is asserted for the same reason. `claude` is a stub on PATH
# that records what it was given — no network, no model, no cost.
#
# Run directly: ./test/stage-prompt-delivery.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
