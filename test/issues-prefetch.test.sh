# test/issues-prefetch.test.sh — regression test for the pre-fetched issues
# source (docs/spec/implementation/requirements, requirement 3j).
#
# The issues source used to be the Co-Ordinator's own `gh` read, and a cycle
# was observed skipping the entire walk on a "no issue data provided in
# input" misreading (20260727T145500Z-poetic-1-1431114). The fix hands the
# candidates over pre-fetched, and three halves of that have to hold outside
# the model, each failing silently if broken:
#
#   - **The deterministic filter.** Assigned issues, `blocked`-labelled
#     issues (whatever the case) and the pull requests the issues endpoint
#     interleaves must be dropped by the gatherer — requirement 16.4's
#     deterministic half — while everything else arrives whole-thread, with
#     its `Priority` band read exactly as the source-state digest reads it.
#   - **The exclusion report.** Every issue the deterministic filter drops
#     (never a pull request, which was never a candidate) must reappear in
#     the sibling `excluded` array with its number and why — agent-ops#447:
#     before this, a drop here left no trace anywhere a human or the
#     dashboard could read.
#   - **Degrading.** An API failure must yield `{"candidates":[],
#     "excluded":null}` (exit 0) with the failure on stderr: the output is
#     *given to* the Co-Ordinator, so an empty `candidates` is a faithful
#     record of its input, and aborting the cycle would make cost control a
#     reliability risk. `excluded` degrades to `null`, not `[]` — the
#     deterministic filter did not run to completion, so the exclusion set
#     is unknown, not known-empty (review decision on agent-ops#452
#     concern 3).
#   - **The fingerprint.** An *edit* to an existing comment moves no field the
#     issues digest samples — not even `updated_at`, which GitHub moves for
#     new comments but not edits — while the Co-Ordinator reads the thread
#     from this array. Hashing the array verbatim is the only thing that
#     wakes the cycle for it; if the fingerprint holds still across a comment
#     edit, a re-scoped instruction waits for an unrelated commit. That is
#     this system's signature failure (see the Gotchas table).
#
# `scripts/gather-issues.sh` is run for real here against a stubbed `gh`, so
# the assertions are about the shipped filter rather than a copy of it. Since
# agent-ops#1085 the listing-plus-comments read is one paginated GraphQL walk
# (`issue_prefetch_open_issues`, lib/issue-prefetch.sh); the stub answers it
# with a fixture in that function's own node shape, applying the caller's own
# `--jq` filter for real, the same technique test/issue-prefetch.test.sh's own
# stub uses.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/issues-prefetch.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
