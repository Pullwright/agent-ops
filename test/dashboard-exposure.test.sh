# test/dashboard-exposure.test.sh — the dashboard answers on the host's
# loopback and on no network.
#
# That is DASHBOARD-SPEC's requirement, and each compose profile arranges it a
# different way, so the ways are what this file guards:
#
#   local    the server binds 0.0.0.0 *inside the container* and the port is
#            published to 127.0.0.1 on the host. Both halves are load-bearing
#            and they fail in opposite directions. Drop the `127.0.0.1:` prefix
#            and the page is published on every interface the host has —
#            silently, because it still works exactly as before from the
#            machine you are testing on. Put the bind back to 127.0.0.1 and the
#            page answers nothing, because a server on the container's own
#            loopback is reachable through no published port.
#   tailnet  the server stays on 127.0.0.1 in the Tailscale sidecar's network
#            namespace, and is reached only through Serve. A `ports:` entry
#            there, or a widened bind, would put it on the host's networks.
#
# The first of those is why this file exists: it is the failure mode with no
# local symptom. The rest are here because the property is "and on no network",
# which no single service can be checked for alone.
#
# The same property, and the same two failure directions, apply to every other
# service that publishes anything — today that is `node-health` (issue #608,
# IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC requirement 58d), which serves `/livez`,
# `/readyz`, `/healthz` and `/metrics` the identical loopback-only way. So the
# closing check here is not "one service publishes" but "these services
# publish, and every mapping any of them declares is scoped to the host's
# loopback": a new `ports:` on a service nobody meant to expose still fails,
# and so does a loopback prefix dropped from any of them.
#
# Scope: this reads `deploy/docker/compose.yaml` and runs
# `scripts/serve-dashboard.sh`. It cannot prove the socket-level result — that
# a request from another machine is refused — because that needs the stack
# actually up, and the suite runs inside the image with no Docker. Acceptance
# check 1c in IMPLEMENTATION-PIPELINE-SPEC is where that is proven; this is the
# guard that runs on every commit.
#
# No network. Run directly: ./test/dashboard-exposure.test.sh — exit 0 iff all
# passed.
