# test/noop-skip.test.sh — regression test for lib/noop-skip.sh.
#
# The no-op short-circuit trades a Co-Ordinator run for a claim: "nothing it
# reads has changed, so its answer cannot have". If the claim is ever wrong in
# the permissive direction, the pipeline stops picking up work and says nothing
# — no error, no failed stage, just tidy `stand-down` events and no PRs. That
# is this system's signature failure (see the Gotchas table), and this rule is
# a fresh opportunity to build one.
#
# So the assertions that matter here are not "it skips when nothing changed"
# (one test) but "it *stops* skipping when each individual source moves" — one
# per source, because a source omitted from the fingerprint fails exactly this
# way and nothing else in the system would tell you. Any new work source added
# to config.json needs a signal in gather-source-state.sh and a case below; a
# source that reaches the Co-Ordinator but not the fingerprint is a stall
# waiting for a quiet week.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/noop-skip.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
