# test/check-node-compose.test.sh — the host-side compose audit (#131),
# against a stubbed `docker` on PATH (as test/watch-node.test.sh stubs it):
# no daemon exists where this suite runs, and the script's job is verdicts,
# not Docker.
#
# The properties that matter:
#   - a synced file, an armed mount, labelled containers and a healthy
#     watchtower pass, exit 0;
#   - a comment-only difference in the file is not a failure — same
#     normalisation, same reasoning as lib/compose-drift.sh;
#   - a material difference fails and shows the diff; a missing mount, a
#     missing hook label, a watchtower without lifecycle hooks, and a
#     watchtower given both schedule and interval each fail on their own;
#   - a stack with no watchtower is information, not a failure — a node
#     without auto-update is a configuration, not a defect;
#   - a reconciler whose last verdict is `refused` fails, quoting its reason,
#     as does one that exists but is not running; a deferral, a missing
#     verdict and a stack with no reconciler at all are information;
#   - a 0600 .env with no backup siblings passes; a non-0600 .env fails
#     naming its actual mode, and each .env.bak*/*.env.old sibling fails
#     naming itself (#696) — checked without Docker, so these still run even
#     when the stack is down;
#   - no compose.yaml in the stack directory, or a scheduler that cannot be
#     exec'd into, is "cannot check" (exit 2), never a clean pass.
#
# Run directly: ./test/check-node-compose.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
