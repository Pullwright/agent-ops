# test/graphql-drift.test.sh — regression test for
# scripts/check-graphql-drift.sh (acceptance check 1g-ii, TD-PPagop-26082930).
#
# A word about what this file can and cannot be. The item this check resolves
# is that *every GitHub read in this repository is asserted only against a
# `gh` stub this repository writes*, so a field GitHub moves cannot fail a
# test. This file stubs `gh` too — and that is not the same mistake repeated,
# because the two halves of the check live in different places. Whether the
# documents still match GitHub's schema is answered by GitHub, nightly, in
# `.github/workflows/graphql-drift.yml`; no stub can answer it and none here
# pretends to. What is left for a unit test is everything *around* that
# answer, all of which is this repository's own logic: which files are
# searched, where a document starts and ends, how it is rewritten so a
# mutation is validated without being run, what is sent on the wire, which
# errors mean drift and which mean the check did not happen, and — the ones
# that matter most — that nothing is ever dropped quietly and that an
# unanswered document is never counted as an answered one.
#
# Most of the cases below exist because the first version of this check got
# them wrong, and a code review found each one by reproducing it. They are
# ordered as that review numbered them where it helps.
#
# The first case runs the real discovery against this repository's own tree,
# so the documents under test are the live ones rather than fixtures: it is
# what would notice a document being added in a form the scanner cannot see.
#
# Run directly:
#
#   ./test/graphql-drift.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# The request is a JSON body posted with `--input`, not `-f query=…` pairs, so
# the stub records the body rather than the argv. That is worth recording:
# `gh api graphql` lifts every `-f`/`-F` pair but `query` into `variables`, so
# a document declaring a variable named `$query` collided with the reserved
# key carrying the document itself.
#
# `ok` answers `{"data":{}}` and nothing else, which is what GitHub returns
# for a document whose whole selection set was skipped — itself worth pinning,
# since a stub answering with data would mean the wrapper had not been applied.
