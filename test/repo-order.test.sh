# test/repo-order.test.sh — regression test for lib/repo-order.sh
# (docs/spec/implementation/requirements requirement 3, acceptance check 1l).
#
# Requirement 3's repo walk decides which repo the Co-Ordinator looks at
# first, every cycle, forever — and per-repo `nice` (config.json's
# `repos[].nice`, default 0, range -19..19) turns that from a plain
# least-recently-updated sort into a weighted one:
#
#   effective_age = (now − epoch(ts)) × 2^(−nice/3)
#
# A mis-weighted walk fails exactly like the system's signature failure mode
# (see the spec's Gotchas table on the fingerprint/back-pressure side of this
# codebase): silently. Nothing errors, nothing logs a mistake — the fleet's
# attention is just spent in the wrong place, cycle after cycle, and the only
# way anyone would notice is a repo that never seems to get picked despite a
# negative nice, or one that hogs every cycle despite a positive one. The
# neutral path (every nice absent or 0) carries the heaviest burden of proof
# of all: it must be provably identical to the old ascending-ISO `sort` this
# replaces, because every repo running today has no `nice` key at all, and a
# neutral-path regression would silently reorder every fleet's walk on the
# same day this ships.
#
# No `gh` stub appears anywhere below, and none is needed: the ordering was
# deliberately extracted out of agent-cycle.sh into the pure function this
# file tests, so the whole of requirement 3's weighting can be verified on
# fixed timestamps and a fixed clock, with no process spawned and no network
# reached.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo); this is a
# plain bash script with hand-rolled assertions. Run it directly:
#
#   ./test/repo-order.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
