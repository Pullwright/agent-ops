# The defect, verbatim from the log that produced it: a Co-Ordinator recorded
#
#   item-void  Poetic-Poems/poetic  TD26072114
#   "PR #92 work is finished: workflow timeout, fetch timeouts,
#    retry-on-rejection and tests all merged; TECH-DEBT.md Ledger marked
#    resolved; only awaiting human review"
#
# while the workflow file on the default branch still had no timeout, the Ledger
# row still read `open`, and PR #92 was still an open, conflicted draft. A void
# is terminal by requirement 34c — no agent may clear one — so the item became
# unreachable from both directions at once: void as a tech-debt candidate, and
# void as the abandoned draft that would have finished it, because a void keys
# on the item and so bypasses the per-head refs of requirements 3e and 3g. Every
# following cycle reported `none-selected` citing the void, the no-op
# fingerprint then matched, and three nodes stood down hourly on a repository
# with outstanding work. Nothing looked broken.
#
# What makes it a mechanism gap rather than a bad model day: every clause of
# that reason was checkable, and the Co-Ordinator is the one void author that
# structurally cannot check — it reads a digest of candidates, never the
# default branch. So the guard tested here is not "was the model careful"; it is
# "did anything corroborate this", and the corroboration is drawn from the same
# candidates the Co-Ordinator was looking at.
