# test/pr-label-claim-stamp.test.sh — regression test for agent-ops#956: the
# claim loop's winning-candidate stamp must write `pr_label` from the Script's
# own configured value, unconditionally, the same way it already writes
# `branch` — never trusting the Co-Ordinator's copy of the runtime input or
# `fallback_select_candidate`'s own composition to be present or correct.
#
# Before this fix, a claimed work order carried whatever `pr_label` (if any)
# the candidate already had, so a Co-Ordinator that omitted or mistyped the
# field raised a pull request no gatherer (`gather-review-feedback.sh`,
# `gather-abandoned-drafts.sh`, `gather-merge-conflicts.sh`,
# `gather-dequeued.sh`, `gather-human-visibility-hygiene.sh`,
# `scripts/sweep-closed-issues.sh`, `lib/merge-budget.sh`) could ever find
# again.
#
# The stamp lives inline in agent-cycle.sh's claim loop, not as a standalone
# function, so this test lifts the exact block whole (the same
# extract-and-eval approach test/refinement-traceability.test.sh uses for its
# own inline blocks) and runs it for real, rather than merely grepping for
# the expected jq invocation.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly: ./test/pr-label-claim-stamp.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
