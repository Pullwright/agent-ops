# test/drain.test.sh — regression test for lib/drain.sh: the at-rest
# detection, the cached progress readers (`--status`, the dashboard, the
# heartbeat) build on, and the deduplicated `drained` event.
#
# The `--drain` CLI surface itself — the mode field, the tighten/error/extend
# precedence, `--enable` clearing either mode, `review-cycle.sh` standing
# down under either — is covered end to end in test/toggle.test.sh's own
# offline e2e section, which already owns the node/gh-stub harness a CLI test
# needs; a second copy of that harness here would only drift from it. This
# file is `lib/drain.sh`'s own pure functions: no `gh`, no lock, no cycle.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/drain.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
