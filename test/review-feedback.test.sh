# test/review-feedback.test.sh — regression test for the candidate rule of
# scripts/gather-review-feedback.sh (requirement 3c).
#
# The rule decides *whose turn it is* on a pull request a human has asked for
# changes on, and it has exactly one dangerous direction. The agent raises PRs
# as the account it runs as, and GitHub forbids approving or dismissing a review
# on your own PR — so `reviewDecision` stays CHANGES_REQUESTED even after the
# fix is pushed. Nothing about the PR's own state ever says "answered". The only
# thing that does is the comparison this file tests: the blocking review
# against GitHub review-thread events (a marked reply, or a review-requested
# event) — never a commit's date, which a force-push re-stamps to push time
# without a human, or the agent, having answered anything (agent-ops#239).
#
# Get it wrong and every PR the agent fixes stays a candidate forever: selected,
# re-fixed, re-selected, on the hour, each cycle looking like a productive one
# and each one paying a Sonnet run to redo work already pushed. The pipeline
# would never look broken.
#
# Most of the rule is tested where it lives — as jq over the same shapes the
# GitHub API returns, with the gatherer's `gh` calls out of reach of a unit
# test. Keep this in step with the filters in the script.
#
# The pagination hazard below is the exception: it is a property of how the
# script's four `gh api --paginate` reads combine across page boundaries, so
# it can only be caught by running the real script (via REVIEW_FEEDBACK_GH)
# against a stub `gh` that actually pages a fixture, the way
# test/merge-conflicts.test.sh's Dependabot section already does for its own
# script (see "The gatherer itself, exercised via a stub gh" below).
#
# Run directly:
#
#   ./test/review-feedback.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# dies silently. Restricting the source list rather than adding a mode flag

# --- The argv cap (requirement 4g, TD-PPagop-26081406) ---
#
# The assembled review body ($fresh/$fresh_comments), the candidate build
# ($pr, a whole pull-request object including its body) and the per-candidate
# append ($cand) all used to ride into jq as --argjson: genuinely unbounded,
# not merely growing — the same shape and the same reasoning that put
# gather-merge-conflicts.sh first on TD-PPagop-26081401's list. Past
# MAX_ARG_STRLEN (131072 bytes) the build died at execve; this repo's whole
# review_feedback band came out empty. Requirement 4g moves all three onto
# stdin.
#
# The candidate build ($pr) is pinned by driving the real script, via the
# same stub gh as the pagination section above, with a PR object whose body
# alone is past the cap — genuinely unbounded even though the candidate's own
# `body` field is assembled from the reviews, not from $pr.body, because the
# whole $pr object rides together regardless of which fields the jq program
# reads. (lib/handoff.sh's own `handoff_answer_events` reads the same
# $reviews array first, before $fresh is even derived — TD-PPagop-26081406
# did not enumerate it, so it was left alone and filed separately as
# TD-PPagop-26081501; that item's own fix is pinned below, driving the real
# script the same way rather than in TD-PPagop-26081501's own
# test/handoff.test.sh, since only running the real script proves this
# script's own upstream call is what benefits.)
# One fixture for every argv-cap scenario below — the PR body, the review
# body and the extracted-block runs all need the same "past MAX_ARG_STRLEN"
# property and nothing else, so generating it once keeps them from drifting
# apart silently when one is edited.
