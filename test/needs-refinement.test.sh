# test/needs-refinement.test.sh — regression test for the refinement class:
# lib/refinement.sh plus the two log extracts it depends on in
# lib/cycle-state.sh (requirements 16a, 34e, 34g, 35d, 36b and 3h).
#
# The defect this closes was a silence. An item the Co-Ordinator could not rank
# — no acceptance criteria, no scope bound, or waiting on a decision only the
# human can take — was skipped, and nothing was recorded. The next cycle read it
# and skipped it. So did every cycle after that, for as long as the item
# existed: a per-hour charge for rediscovering the same non-answer, an item with
# no route to ever becoming selectable, and a human who was never told any of it
# was happening. Nothing looked broken.
#
# So the rules below are asserted in both directions throughout, because both
# failures are silent and they cost differently:
#
#   - too shy — a report dropped, a block not recorded, an item over the
#     engagement cap that never comes back — and the item starves exactly as it
#     did before this existed;
#   - too eager — a re-report that resets the Enabler threshold every cycle, a
#     second refinement of an item an expensive model already specified — and
#     the pipeline spends real money going round in a circle, while every event
#     in the log reads like progress.
#
# `gh` is stubbed through REFINEMENT_GH. No test framework is used (none exists
# elsewhere in this repo). Run it directly:
#
#   ./test/needs-refinement.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# The `eligible` helper below takes its threshold and window as optional
# arguments (`${1:-3}`, `${2:-0}`), so most calls pass none and read as the
# default case — which is the point. shellcheck reads a function that names $1
# and is called bare as a mistake in one direction or the other; here it is
# neither.
