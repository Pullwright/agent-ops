# test/verdict-corroboration.test.sh — regression tests for the Script-side
# pieces of requirements 3t/3u/3x (issues #310, #320, #322), all lifted whole
# out of agent-cycle.sh rather than reimplemented, so a change to the real
# function is what this suite exercises:
#
#   - exclude_blocked_or_void_items: every pre-fetched band's second exclusion
#     pass, applied once blocked_json/void_json are final — a candidate whose
#     ref is blocked or void for its own repo never reaches the Co-Ordinator,
#     the same deterministic-code decision exclude_claimed_items already makes
#     for claims (requirement 3q).
#   - coordinator_eligible_items: the Script's own answer to "what could the
#     Co-Ordinator actually have selected this cycle", across every band it
#     pre-fetches — the denominator the corroboration below is tested against
#     (requirement 3x). Its three non-obvious bands are the point: `issues` is
#     banded per entry and still carries blocked entries, and
#     `merge_conflicts` carries the one shape the prompt tells the model to
#     skip in silence.
#   - unaccounted_items: the machine corroboration a `selected: false` verdict
#     is tested against — which eligible items were neither reported in
#     needs_refinement under their own source nor voided, the evidence a
#     none-selected verdict misdescribing a band leaves behind (the
#     2026-08-10..12 incident requirement 3t exists for, generalised off the
#     one band it was proven on by requirement 3x).
#   - log_needs_refinement_items / log_voided_items: the recording loops whose
#     own collections (`coord_recorded_refinement_json`,
#     `coord_recorded_voided_json`) are what the corroboration is actually fed
#     — what the Script *recorded*, never what the message *claimed*. The
#     asymmetry between the two is the point under test: a needs_refinement
#     entry dropped at requirement 34d's bar records nothing and must not
#     account for its item (or the fingerprint arms on a verdict that never
#     engaged with the band — the freeze, reopened), while a voided entry the
#     guard refuses still accounts, because the refusal itself is recorded as
#     a block.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/verdict-corroboration.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# --- The argv cap (requirement 4g, TD-PPagop-26081406) ---
#
# coord_recorded_refinement_json/coord_recorded_voided_json grow by one
# accepted entry per call and are what log_needs_refinement_items/
# log_voided_items fold the newest entry into — both used to ride into jq as
# a second --argjson alongside the growing accumulator itself (delivered on
# stdin already). Past MAX_ARG_STRLEN (131072 bytes) that fold died at
# execve, silently losing every report/void recorded so far — the accumulator
# reset to whatever the last successful append produced, not what the cycle
# actually recorded. Requirement 4g moves the new entry onto stdin too.
#
# Both functions reset their accumulator to `[]` at the top of every call
# (proved above: "no reports collects an empty array, not a stale one"), so
# an oversized accumulator can only be reached within a *single* call's own
# needs_refinement/voided array — not by seeding the variable and calling
# again. Driving that many real entries through the whole recording loop
# (event logging, the requirement 34d bar, the fold) is what made an earlier
# attempt at this section, in test/coordinator-retry-fallback.test.sh, run
# for minutes: each fold re-serialises the whole accumulator, so the total
# cost is quadratic in entry count. That file's own section pins the
# downstream build cheaply, by assigning the accumulator directly rather
# than re-deriving it; this one instead lifts the fold line itself — the
# same one-line pattern this file already runs for real above, now isolated
# — and proves it survives an already-oversized accumulator in one call, the
# same technique test/pr-claim-exclusion.test.sh's `extract_claims_fold` uses
# for the identical shape.
