# test/pickup-metrics.test.sh — regression test for scripts/pickup-metrics.sh
# (TD-PPagop-26080808, issue #248 acceptance 5).
#
# What matters here:
#
#   the split       "before"/"after" is per node, at that node's own first
#                    `chained` event — a node with no `chained` event at all
#                    is entirely "before".
#   what counts as   a `claim-lost` whose `cause` is `held` or `pr-held`;
#   contention       every other cause, and a line carrying no `cause` at
#                    all, is excluded rather than guessed at.
#   --since          bounds which events are counted and the reported
#                    window, but never which `chained` event counts as a
#                    node's first — adoption can predate the window a report
#                    asks about.
#   malformed input  a line that is not valid JSON is skipped, not fatal —
#                    the log is appended to while this script reads it.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/pickup-metrics.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
