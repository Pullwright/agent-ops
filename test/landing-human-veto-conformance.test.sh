# test/landing-human-veto-conformance.test.sh — conformance sweep for D18's
# standing invariant that a human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` blocks landing at every
# rung of the `merge_autonomy` ladder (agent-ops#577, part of #402).
#
# `test/landing-wiring.test.sh` already pins each of `_landing_stage_attempt`'s
# seven gates in isolation, including one case for the human-veto gate
# ("Gate 4 (human half)") — but that case, like every other in that file, runs
# only at the harness's own default `LEVEL="agent-merges-routine"`. It proves
# the gate refuses there; it says nothing about `human`, `agent-approves` or
# `agent-merges-all`, and nothing about whether the veto is insensitive to
# which landing path (a merge queue on the base branch, or the no-queue
# auto-merge fallback) this pull request would otherwise take. This file is
# the sweep that closes that gap: all four `merge_autonomy` levels crossed
# with both landing paths, eight cases, one standing human `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
# throughout.
#
# The shape point settled on the issue (2026-08-21, after escalation #628):
# `_landing_stage_attempt`'s gate 1 refuses on the effective level *before*
# gate 4 (the human-veto gate, `_handoff_blocking_reviewers`) is ever
# consulted. So at `human` and `agent-approves` the assertable fact is "nothing
# arms, and the refusal names the level" — the veto gate never runs and cannot
# name itself. Only at `agent-merges-routine` and `agent-merges-all` does the
# refusal come from the veto, naming the blocking reviewer. Both shapes are
# swept below; neither is written four times.
#
# The "both landing paths" axis is `ARM_METHOD` — what `landing_arm` (stubbed
# here, exactly as `landing-wiring.test.sh` stubs it) would have returned had
# it ever been called: `enqueued` for a base branch with an active merge
# queue, `auto-merge` for the no-queue fallback. In every one of the eight
# cases below the veto refuses upstream of gate 5/6 and the arm write itself
# (`_landing_stage_attempt`'s own fixed gate order — see its header in
# agent-cycle.sh), so `landing_arm` is never actually invoked regardless of
# which path it would have taken; asserting `arms == 0` in both configurations
# is what proves neither landing path offers a way around the veto, rather
# than the two configurations being distinguishable only in a label. Which
# path `landing_arm` genuinely takes for a real base branch, and that it takes
# the right one, is `test/landing.test.sh`'s own "landing_arm" section
# (queue vs. no-queue, against a stubbed `gh`) — not re-proven here.
#
# The freshness half of the invariant — that a `DISMISSED` earlier position
# does not survive as a stale "cleared" verdict once a later standing
# `CHANGES_REQUESTED` supersedes it — is a claim about `_handoff_latest_reviews`
# /`_handoff_blocking_reviewers`'s own reading of a real review history, which
# this file's stubbed `_handoff_blocking_reviewers` cannot exercise (it never
# reads a review list at all). That case lives in `test/handoff.test.sh`,
# alongside the function's other direct coverage.
#
# The shell options and extraction technique are `test/landing-wiring.test.sh`'s
# own, for the reason its header gives: `agent-cycle.sh` runs under
# `set -euo pipefail`, under which a gate that reports its own refusal via exit
# status (`review_gate_verdict`) would abort the cycle on a bare assignment
# rather than refuse — a difference only observable by running the lifted code
# under the same options production does.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/landing-human-veto-conformance.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
