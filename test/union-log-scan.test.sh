# test/union-log-scan.test.sh — the union event stream is read by streaming it,
# never by slurping it into one string and regex-splitting that (#791).
#
# Despite the shared stem, this is not the unit test for `lib/union-log-scan.sh`
# (#1050): this file is a fleet-wide guard over every union-log reader's
# *shape*, whichever file it lives in, and predates that library. That
# library's own `landing_retry_source_map` is pinned in `test/landing.test.sh`,
# beside the two call sites it serves.
#
# What this guards: `jq -R -s '[ splits("\n") | ... ]'` is a regex match over
# the *whole* input. It is super-linear, and the log it reads only ever grows.
# On 2026-08-25 eight readers shared that shape; on `poetic-2`, one
# `crash_loop_verdict` call over a 9.5 MB `.fleet-log.jsonl` was still running
# after 13 minutes at ~90% of a core, and substantive cycles were taking 69 to
# 155 minutes on a box whose no-op cycles finish in one second.
#
# Measured on the same file, same jq, the two forms — which tolerate malformed
# lines identically, since each applies `fromjson? // empty` per line:
#
#     lines    bytes   -R -s + splits("\n")   -R -n + inputs
#     2,500   429 KB              3,607 ms            15 ms
#     5,000   974 KB             16,246 ms            28 ms

# ~4.5x per doubling against ~2x. The two assertions below are deliberately

# hottest reader, so the guard cannot be satisfied by a rewrite that keeps the

# 20,000 events is a plausible union log for a fleet a few weeks old — smaller

# second. Slurp-and-split took 335 s on the same input on the machine the table
# above was measured on, so the bound below sits ~5x under the old behaviour
# and ~100x over the new: generous to a slow or loaded CI box, and still
# incapable of passing if the quadratic form returns.
