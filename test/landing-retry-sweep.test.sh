# test/landing-retry-sweep.test.sh — regression test for
# `_landing_retry_sweep_repo`, the 2.1e landing-retry sweep's own candidate
# rule (requirement 8u, TD-PPagop-26081701).
#
# `test/landing-wiring.test.sh` already covers the six gates
# `_landing_stage_attempt` runs once a candidate reaches it, including a
# direct call with RETRY set. This file covers what decides which pull
# requests reach that call at all: the level pre-check, the open/non-draft/
# complexity filter, the standing-Approver-review precondition, and the
# `landing_retry_source` lookup that resolves the one gate this sweep cannot
# re-read fresh from GitHub. `_landing_stage_attempt` itself is stubbed here
# — this file is about what is offered to it, never about what it does with
# an offer — except for its own `_landing_stage_attempt_armed` global, which
# the stub sets on cue so this file can also pin the per-pass merge-budget
# bound: `armed_this_pass`, threaded through as `_landing_stage_attempt`'s own
# ALREADY_ARMED argument, must grow by exactly one after each candidate the
# stub reports as armed and stay put after one it reports as refused (PR #557
# review of TD-PPagop-26081701).
#
# `_landing_retry_sweep_repo` is lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the
# same technique test/landing-wiring.test.sh and its siblings use, so the
# assertions are about the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/landing-retry-sweep.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
#
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
# This file assembles a harness script whose `$`-expressions must reach the
# assembled file unexpanded; the single-quoted here-doc and `printf` lines
# below are deliberate.
