# stage_budget_json is read only by the extracted `stage_budget_apply` body
# below, `eval`-defined rather than sourced, so shellcheck cannot see the use
# and reports it unused — the same false positive lib/merge-observed.sh's own
# header disables for the same reason (a variable this file's own functions
# read and write, assigned once here rather than locally).
#
# test/stage-budget-apply-join-key.test.sh — regression test for the
# item-lifecycle join key (requirement 49, issue #595) on `stage-start`:
# `stage_budget_apply` (agent-cycle.sh) carries `{repo, item}` when its
# caller has them, and omits both — never logs a literal `null` — when REPO
# is the fleet-wide `*` a stage that runs ahead of or across selection
# passes (the Co-Ordinator, the Enabler, the Refiner) or ITEM is left empty.
#
# `stage_budget_apply` itself is lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the
# same technique test/landing-wiring.test.sh and its siblings use, so the
# assertions are about the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic.
# `lib/stage-budget.sh` (`stage_budget_resolve`, `STAGE_BUDGET_PRIORS`) runs
# for real — it is a small, already-tested pure resolution
# (test/stage-budget.test.sh covers it directly) — and only
# `stage_budget_overrides` (agent-cycle.sh's own per-repo config read) and
# `log_event` are stubbed.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/stage-budget-apply-join-key.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
