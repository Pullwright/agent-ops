# test/close-void-github-items.test.sh — act on a corroborated void by
# closing the GitHub object it names (requirement 34k, issue #240).
#
# What this guards: poetic-fiddle #190/#214 were re-derived void on 7+
# separate cycles and never closed, resurfacing as candidates every time
# because nothing ever touched the object itself. This script's whole job is
# to close it once, on the first cycle that sees the void, and never again.
#
# It also guards the opposite failure: pull request #264 — a ready PR of ours
# carrying a human review round — was closed unmerged when an unrelated
# merge-conflicts void (`pr-264-conflict-…`) was actioned after its conflict
# resolved (TD-PPagop-26080901). That shape names a pull request only to say
# the *conflict* on it is gone, never that the pull request itself is; case 4b
# pins it left alone. Its sibling shape, `pr-<n>-superseded-…` (a Dependabot
# bump a newer open bump made moot, TD-PPagop-26081304), makes the opposite
# claim — the pull request itself is moot — so case 4c pins it closed like any
# other pull-request void.
#
# `gh` is a stub on PATH via SWEEP_GH; no network.
#
# Run directly: ./test/close-void-github-items.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
