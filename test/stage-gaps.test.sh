# test/stage-gaps.test.sh — a stage's inter-event gaps are measured while it
# runs, and summarised as requirement 33a / docs/METERING-SCHEMA.md describe.
#
# A gap is the interval between one growth of the stage's event stream and the
# next. Nothing in the finished transcript records it — the envelope says the
# run took 30 minutes and 47 turns, and is silent about whether those turns
# were evenly spread or whether the run sat still for eleven minutes in the
# middle. That distinction is the whole point of measuring: a cap sized
# against durations cannot tell a busy stage from a wedged one, and these
# numbers are what a liveness threshold is eventually sized from.
#
# Two halves, and they fail in different ways:
#
#   the arithmetic   `stage_gap_stats` against a known sample. Nearest-rank,
#                    not interpolated, so every printed figure is a silence
#                    that really happened — checked here at the awkward ranks
#                    (a single observation, an even count, p99 of a small
#                    sample) rather than only in the middle where every
#                    definition agrees.
#   the measurement  `run_model_stage` against a stub that emits with
#                    controlled pauses. This is the half that could pass
#                    vacuously: a run whose gaps were never sampled and a run
#                    with no gaps both report small numbers, so the pauses
#                    here are made long enough that a working measurement and
#                    a broken one cannot produce the same answer.
#
# The measurement half is timing-dependent, so its assertions are one-sided —
# "at least this long", never an exact figure — and its pauses are sized well
# clear of the two-second poll resolution. A loaded machine makes a gap look
# longer, never shorter, so a bound from below is the shape that cannot flake.
#
# `claude` is a stub on PATH — no network, no model, no cost.
#
# Run directly: ./test/stage-gaps.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
