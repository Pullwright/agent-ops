# test/open-question-cycle-wiring.test.sh — regression test for the
# open-question label-projection block in agent-cycle.sh (requirement 8f,
# agent-ops#668), guarding against agent-ops#889: `landing_open_question_
# label_project` (lib/landing.sh) documents exit 1 for its own `unrecorded`
# and `failed` words as ordinary, non-fatal outcomes — a repository this
# pipeline has not created the label in yet is the practical case, not a
# fault. Under this script's `set -euo pipefail`, an unguarded `var=$(cmd)`
# assignment takes on that exit status, and bash treats it exactly like any
# other failed command: the whole cycle exits before `run_approver_stage` or
# `run_landing_stage` ever run, stranding a green, ready pull request with
# no Approver review and no landing arming. Six fleet cycles hit this for
# real inside one week (see #889's own evidence table) before both
# `landing_open_question_label_project` call sites were guarded with
# `|| true`.
#
# The block is lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the same way
# test/closing-keyword-wiring.test.sh and test/approver-wiring.test.sh lift
# their own blocks, so the assertions are about the shipped code rather than
# a copy of its logic. `jq` runs for real; everything that talks to GitHub,
# launches a model, self-heals a label or writes the log is stubbed and
# recorded.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/open-question-cycle-wiring.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
