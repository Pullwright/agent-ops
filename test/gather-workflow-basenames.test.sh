# test/gather-workflow-basenames.test.sh — regression test for
# scripts/gather-workflow-basenames.sh (requirement 34n's liveness
# retirement, TD-PPagop-26081303): the id -> basename map a `failed-run-<…>`
# void entry is tested against.
#
# Behaviours asserted, each of which fails silently if broken:
#
#   - **A successful read maps each workflow id to its file's basename**,
#     without the `.github/workflows/` prefix or the `.yml`/`.yaml`
#     extension.
#   - **An API failure reports `ok: false` and an empty map** — never a
#     partial map read as complete, which is exactly the "unknown is not
#     gone" failure requirement 34n's liveness rule guards against.
#
# The gatherer is run for real against a stubbed `gh`.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/gather-workflow-basenames.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
