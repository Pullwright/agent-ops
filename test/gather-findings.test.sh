# test/gather-findings.test.sh — regression test for the argv cap
# (docs/spec/implementation/requirements, requirement 4g; TD-PPagop-26081503)
# in scripts/gather-findings.sh's combine-and-order build.
#
# `$dependabot_json` and `$code_scanning_json` are each a repo's whole open
# finding list — unbounded past this call — and used to ride into the final
# `jq -n` as two separate `--argjson` values. Past `MAX_ARG_STRLEN`
# (131072 bytes) the build dies at `execve`, and a repo with a large backlog
# of open alerts — exactly the repo whose `findings` band matters most —
# comes back empty.
#
# The gatherer is run for real here against a stubbed `gh` (via
# `DASHBOARD_GH_CMD`, the script's own test seam), with the Dependabot list
# fixtured past the cap, so what is asserted is the shipped build rather than
# a copy of its logic.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/gather-findings.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
