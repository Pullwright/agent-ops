# test/sweep-orphan-branches.test.sh — an orphaned claim branch is put back in
# front of the pipeline (requirement 17b, acceptance check 7b).
#
# What this guards: an Implementer that pushes commits and dies before its
# draft PR exists leaves a moved ref no machinery can see — the gc keeps it
# (pushed work is never deleted), the abandoned-drafts gatherer lists PRs, not
# branches, and every later claim 422s against it. The item is wedged forever
# and nothing says so. The sweep's whole value is in its guards, each of which
# fails in a different direction if lost:
#
#   open PR          the ordinary machinery owns it — touch nothing
#   registry entry   a live claim — touch nothing
#   registry error   an unanswered question (only a clean 404 proves absence,
#                    TD-PPagop-26080201's lesson) — touch nothing, say so
#   young tip        someone may still be working — wait
#   ahead > 0        the work becomes a draft PR the abandoned-drafts source
#                    recovers; the label it keys on must be on it
#   ahead == 0       the ref was only ever the claim, and the claim is dead
#   the cap          a backlog surfaces a few per cycle, and the overflow is
#                    reported, never silent
#
