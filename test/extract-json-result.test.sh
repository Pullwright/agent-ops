# test/extract-json-result.test.sh — the final-message parser's three copies
# (agent-cycle.sh, review-cycle.sh, and publish-dashboard.sh's jq port) accept
# the same shapes and agree on every case. docs/spec/dashboard/state.md's "same
# algorithm" claim, made checkable.
#
# What this guards: on 2026-08-03 an Enabler engagement examined three
# refinement items, reached a correct `escalate` verdict on each, drafted
# every escalation issue — and ended with a summary paragraph, a blank line,
# and the verdict object, bare. The parser of the day accepted pure JSON or a
# fenced ```json block and nothing else, so the engagement was discarded
# whole, and the items sat behind its never-released claims for the rest of
# claim_ttl_hours. The bare-object-suffix salvage exists for exactly that
# shape; the cases below pin it, pin what it deliberately still refuses (an
# object with trailing prose, a summary that merely mentions braces), and pin
# the three copies to each other so the dashboard never renders as silent a
# verdict the cycle accepted.
#
# Also guarded: issue #237's shape, a verdict fenced without a `json` info
# string (or with a different one). The fence fallback used to require the
# literal tag and so missed it — on 2026-08-07 that discarded poetic-2's
# completed conflict resolution of PR #205, erasing pipeline memory that the
# conflict was fixed. The fence matcher now toggles on any ``` line, tagged
# or not, in or out of a block.
#
# The implementations are lifted from their scripts rather than restated
# here, so this cannot pass against copies the scripts have since moved on
# from; each extraction asserts it found something for the same reason. The
# two bash copies run in their own `bash -c` child because they share a
# function name; no network, no model, no cost.
#
# Run directly: ./test/extract-json-result.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
