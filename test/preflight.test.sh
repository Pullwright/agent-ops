# test/preflight.test.sh — regression test for lib/preflight.sh (issue #245):
# the done-check the Script runs on the item a cycle just claimed, before it
# pays for an Implementer engagement.
#
# `preflight_done_reason` is a thin wrapper: `work_gone_clearances`
# (test/work-gone.test.sh already covers that function's own decisions in
# depth) around a one-entry blocked list. `preflight_defer_reason` is the
# stale-open-PR check for an ordinary issues/tech-debt item — a defer signal,
# never a void-feeding one (#279), which is why it must stay out of
# `preflight_done_reason`'s answer. `preflight_branch_merged_reason` is the
# other, impure, done-signal — one live `gh api compare` call, stubbed below —
# and `preflight_existing_branch_source` is the gate that gh call is never
# reached without. `preflight_review_feedback_reason` is the third, and
# reuses `lib/handoff.sh`'s `handoff_latest_positions` (issue #1373,
# requirement 34a), hence sourcing that file below too.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/preflight.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
