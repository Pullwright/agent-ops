# test/enabler-verdicts.test.sh — regression test for `maybe_run_enabler`'s
# verdict switch in agent-cycle.sh (requirements 36a, 36b), the piece that
# translates an Enabler engagement's JSON verdicts into log events.
#
# TD-PPagop-26080805: nothing in test/ ever called `maybe_run_enabler`.
# `test/enabler-eligibility.test.sh` feeds `enabler-examined` events in as log
# *fixtures* to exercise the eligibility extract on the other side of the
# loop; nothing drove the switch that produces them. Two outcomes matter most
# because they are the failure paths, not the happy ones:
#
#   - `void-refused`  — requirement 34d's shared corroboration guard refusing
#     the Enabler's own `void` (PR #258, issue #243).
#   - `refinement-refused` — requirement 36b's thrash guard refusing a second
#     refinement of an item already refined once since the last human touch.
#   - `complete_handoff` (requirements 31c/32b, agent-ops#440) — refused when
#     this item's recorded failure never reached the Reviewer stage (PR #433:
#     the Implementer failed, the Reviewer block never ran, and this recovery
#     path flipped the pull request to ready anyway) or when `handoff_
#     complete_review`'s (lib/handoff.sh) own gate finds a real fault — the
#     same gate the Reviewer's own handoff runs, genuinely shared rather than
#     skipped on this path. test/handoff.test.sh covers `handoff_complete_
#     review` itself; what this file proves is that `maybe_run_enabler` calls
#     it at all, and reacts to `safe: false` by refusing the flip rather than
#     performing it anyway.
#
# All three exist to keep a wrong *permanent* verdict — or a wrong *act*, for
# `complete_handoff` — from being recorded, and their whole value is in what
# they write (or refuse to do) instead of the verdict the model asked for. A
# silent regression here would put an item back where the guard exists to
# keep it out of, while every event in the log still read like an ordinary
# examination.
#
# The harness, not the assertions, is the work (per the tech-debt item's own
# suggested fix): `maybe_run_enabler` is lifted whole out of agent-cycle.sh
# with awk, the same technique test/signal-exit.test.sh uses for the signal
# block, and run with the library functions it actually depends on for
# correctness — `void_guard_reason` (lib/void-guard.sh),
# `refinement_second_pass_refused`/`refinement_engagement_set`
# (lib/refinement.sh), `item_event_fields` (lib/cycle-state.sh) — sourced for
# real, so this test exercises the genuine guards rather than a paraphrase of
# them. Everything with a side effect outside the process — `claude` itself,
# `gh`, the state-repo claim registry — is stubbed. Most evidence and verdict
# text used throughout is free of `PR #`/`commit <sha>` citations and of
# `{ref,path,expect,pattern}`-shaped evidence, since what is under test is the
# switch's wiring, not the citation checker (test/void-guard.test.sh already
# covers that in depth). Issue #413 (WI-10) closed `void_guard_reason`'s own
# fall-through for evidence shaped like that, though, so the two scenarios
# that need a `void` to actually corroborate now use a finishing-source item
# id (`pr-<n>-abandoned-…`) instead — corroborated directly against that
# pull request's own live state (`void_finishing_pr_reason`) via the smallest
# `gh` stub that can answer it (`closed`, which corroborates outright,
# whatever the evidence text says).
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run it
# directly:
#
#   ./test/enabler-verdicts.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# escalate, decide-with-veto (PR #1389, requirement 36f): the fourth
# rung. Same pass, same tier, same bound — two things differ, and both are
# what these cases pin. First, the `mandate` the Script hands the pass:
# `delegate` here, `tactical` at `decide-tactical`. Second, what the Script
# does with a `decide` verdict that carries an `act`: it records it as a
# *pending* decision and leaves the item blocked, because the act has not
# happened yet and the veto window is the whole point of the rung.
# `run_enabler_decide`'s own refusal of an act the mandate does not reach is
# the last section of this file, against the real function.

# agent-ops#815: escalation_thread_reconcile's own comment body.
#
# Deliberately last in the file. Every scenario above stubs this function out
# to assert only that `maybe_run_enabler` calls it, with which outcome and
# which number — the right coverage for the *caller*. This section evals the
# real one over that stub, so nothing above it can be affected, and asserts
# the thing the caller's coverage cannot reach: what actually lands on the
# human's thread.
#
# The `Blocked-by:` assertion is not a spelling check. Requirement 36b's whole
# claim is that the filed case's comment makes the dependency *deterministic*
# — `scripts/gather-issues.sh` excludes the work item as `blocked-by: #<n>`
# from that line alone — and the reference sits inside a string interpolated
# between a header line and a marker line, where anything that folds it back
# into the prose beside it ("Escalation filed: <url>, Blocked-by: #90", the
# obvious tidy-up) costs it its own line and silently stops `dependency_refs`
# matching, while every assertion above still passes. So it is asserted
# through the real `dependency_refs` (lib/dependency-gate.sh) — the actual
# reader, leading whitespace and all — rather than against the literal text.
#
# The two correcting outcomes are asserted from both directions for the same
# reason the file's other guards are: saying "no escalation was filed" is only
# half of it — a correcting comment that still carried a `Blocked-by:` line
# would re-assert the very block it exists to withdraw, and would read as a
# live dependency to the next gather.
