# test/crash-loop-escalate.test.sh — the requirement-2.7 crash-loop wiring in
# lib/enabler.sh that actually files, defers and retires escalations
# (agent-ops#1074), as opposed to test/crash-loop.test.sh's coverage of the
# pure detectors in lib/crash-loop.sh those functions call.
#
# What this guards: the 2026-08-29/30 Ockham outage (agent-ops#1070) showed
# that a *retried* escalation attempt — one a previous cycle already tried
# and failed to file — must never be filed straight off a verdict computed
# before this cycle's own Co-Ordinator has had its chance to prove the run
# over. `crash_loop_escalate_or_defer` is where that distinction is made;
# `crash_loop_refile_pending` (run from `cleanup()`, after every stage this
# cycle might run) is where a deferred attempt is finally re-verified and
# either filed or dropped; `crash_loop_retire_resolved` is the other half —
# closing an already-open escalation once its run has broken.
#
# Everything with a side effect outside the process — `gh`, GitHub issue
# creation — is stubbed. `log_event` is replaced with a tiny recorder so
# assertions can inspect exactly which events these functions emit, without
# needing agent-cycle.sh's own logging plumbing (`$log_file`, `$cycle_id`,
# `$node_name`) along for the ride. `lib/fleet.sh`'s real `fleet_logs` runs
# unstubbed against real temp files, since `crash_loop_refile_pending`'s
# whole point is regathering the union log for real.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run it
# directly:
#
#   ./test/crash-loop-escalate.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
