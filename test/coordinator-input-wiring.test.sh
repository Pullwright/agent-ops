# test/coordinator-input-wiring.test.sh — regression test for requirement 4i's
# block in agent-cycle.sh (agent-ops#641): not whether the ladder is right
# (`test/coordinator-input.test.sh` covers that) but whether the Script hands
# it the right allowance and does the right things with what comes back.
#
# The seam is the whole point here. The bound is only worth what its arithmetic
# is worth: subtract too little and the assembled prompt still overflows, which
# is the outage; subtract too much and the fit trims prose nobody needed to
# lose. And the block has two side effects the union log depends on — an
# informational `coordinator-input-fitted` when it trimmed, and a `warning`
# when even the last rung could not fit — either of which could be dropped by
# an edit without a single assertion elsewhere noticing.
#
# So the assertions here are about what the block computes and emits:
#
#   - **The allowance is the configured maximum less everything the fit cannot
#     shed.** Measured, end to end, by reassembling the real prompt around the
#     block's own output and checking it against `coordinator_prompt_max_bytes`.
#   - **The overhead is taken against an empty `repos`.** An overhead measured
#     against the unfitted array would shrink the allowance as the fit worked,
#     because the two differ by the indentation of the lines the fit removes.
#   - **`0` means the bound is off, and the input passes through untouched.**
#   - **Trimming is recorded; failing to fit is recorded louder.**
#
# The block is lifted verbatim out of agent-cycle.sh, the way
# test/backpressure-wiring.test.sh lifts its own, so the assertions are about
# the shipped code rather than a copy of its logic.
#
# No network and no `claude`: the block reads config variables and JSON this
# test sets, and `log_event`/`guard_warn` are stubs that record their arguments.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run directly:
# ./test/coordinator-input-wiring.test.sh — exit 0 iff all passed.
