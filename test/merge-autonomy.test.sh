# test/merge-autonomy.test.sh — regression test for lib/merge-autonomy.sh.
#
# Two things worth breaking separately: the config resolution
# (merge_autonomy_configured_level — top-level default, per-repo override,
# same precedence stage_timeouts uses) and the kill switch
# (merge_autonomy_kill_set/_state/_clear, wrapping lib/toggle.sh's generic
# fleet-flag machinery under its own flag name). merge_autonomy_effective_level
# is the one function that combines both, and the acceptance this whole item
# is graded on — "the kill switch flips every repo's effective level to
# `human` and back without a container restart" — is exactly what its own
# assertions below prove: the same process, the same config, flipping only the
# fleet flag between reads.
#
# No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this repo). Run
# directly:
#
#   ./test/merge-autonomy.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.

# --- agent-ops#1118: case 2 — the kill flag's own 404 is ordinary (the flag
#     is genuinely absent, the normal steady state), but the repo probe that
#     404 sends to confirm it (TD-PPagop-26081602's own `probe-404` mode) is
#     itself what fails, with a distinct, rate-limit-shaped cause. $cache.err
#     holds only the flag's unhelpful "Not Found"; the real diagnosis is in
#     $cache.repo-err. Before this fix, both the RETRY classification and
#     run_approver_stage's own warning read $cache.err alone, so a rate-limit
#     refusal here was neither retried (github_limit_kind saw "Not Found", not
#     the real cause, and answered "none") nor reported accurately. -----------
